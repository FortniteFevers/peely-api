         "content": "<p>Hey Fortnite Competitive Players,<br />\n<br />\nFrom everyone on the team, we hope you are enjoying Chapter 2 - Season 5! As we close out 2020 and head into 2021, we wanted to provide an update to you on what you can expect competitive Fortnite play to be like in 2021 and beyond.</p>\n\n<h2>In-Person Tournaments Update</h2>\n\n<p>Our intent is to eventually hold global in-person tournaments again, but our priority for any such event is the health and safety of our players and staff. With so much still unknown about what is practical and safe, we do not plan to hold in-person events in&nbsp; 2021, including a Fortnite World Cup. We will continue to provide online competitions throughout 2021 with the hopes that physical events, in some form, can return at some point in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS Trios for all of 2021</h2>\n\n<p>FNCS will continue throughout 2021, and we are standardizing the FNCS party size to Trios for the foreseeable future! While Trios will be a constant in FNCS, we still may alter the scoring and/or qualification formats season by season. Our hope with this change is to place more stability and consistency around FNCS.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 2 - Season 5 FNCS is planned to begin February 4. This date allows plenty of time for players to adjust to the new season and give our team more time to make adjustments before FNCS play. We\u2019ll have more detailed information for FNCS as we get closer to February.</p>\n\n<h2>More Tournaments</h2>\n\n<p>FNCS will be the constant measure of success in competitive Fortnite, but we\u2019re looking at other avenues for high-level competition 2021. Beyond our biggest competitions, in 2021, we\u2019re putting together a schedule featuring more weekly tournaments, unique tournaments, and Creator Cups throughout the year. There will be plenty of competitions (not just Trios!) to scratch the competitive itch between FNCS seasons.</p>\n\n<h2>Chapter 2 - Season 5 Changes</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be monitoring some of the new gameplay mechanics in Chapter 2 - Season 5 and how they work in competitive playlists. With competitive playlists, the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-bars-and-bounties-in-season-5\">new Bars system</a> will reset&nbsp; players to 0 Bars at the start of each match, and these Bars cannot be carried over between competitive matches. We\u2019re still discussing ideas of further implementing this system into competitive, without negatively affecting gameplay. We\u2019ll be paying close attention to your feedback this season with this new mechanic.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone that competed this year! We look forward to what the future holds.</p>\n<br />\n-The Fortnite Team",

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match throwing or fixing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from a match without a legitimate reason for doing so.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). &nbsp;For clarity, a player\u2019s receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d).

If Event Organizer witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct, Event Organizer should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator at tournaments@epicgames.com. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player or Event Organizer for bringing forward a complaint or cooperating in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by Event Organizer, Event Administrators, Epic, or each of their respective affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer is authorized to make decisions regarding violations of these Rules in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review. If Event Organizer decides that a player has violated these Rules (including the Code of Conduct), Event Organizer may disqualify the player from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Without limitation of the foregoing, Epic, at its sole discretion, may monitor the Event and enforce any applicable punishment specified in these Rules, Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, and/or the Fortnite EULA.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, the disqualification of a player or the enforcement of any applicable punishment by Event Organizer and/or Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Event Organizer or Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Event Organizer and/or Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer has binding authority to decide all player disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Event Organizer which shall be binding, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Event Organizer and Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Epic events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nEXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND AS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PLAYER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES (OR, IF A MINOR, SUCH PLAYER\u2019S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES ON SUCH PLAYER\u2019S BEHALF) ANY RIGHT S/HE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, ANY PRIZE AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.<br />\n<br />\n13. &nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\n<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match).

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Retaliation against any player or Event Organizer for bringing forward a complaint or cooperating in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by Event Organizer, Event Administrators, Epic, or each of their respective affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer is authorized to make decisions regarding violations of these Rules in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.

Without limitation of the foregoing, Epic, at its sole discretion, may monitor the Event and enforce any applicable punishment specified in these Rules, Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, and/or the Fortnite EULA.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, the disqualification of a player or the enforcement of any applicable punishment by Event Organizer and/or Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Event Organizer or Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Event Organizer and/or Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer has binding authority to decide all player disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Event Organizer which shall be binding, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Event Organizer and Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Epic events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nEXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND AS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PLAYER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES (OR, IF A MINOR, SUCH PLAYER\u2019S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES ON SUCH PLAYER\u2019S BEHALF) ANY RIGHT S/HE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, ANY PRIZE AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.<br />\n<br />\n13. &nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\n<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Prizes are not transferable or assignable and cannot be transferred by Winning Players. Non-cash prizes (if any) cannot be redeemed for cash. All prize details are at the sole discretion of Epic. Terms and conditions may apply to acceptance and use of a prize.<br />\n<br />\nThe highest scoring players will be notified by Epic of their status as a potential Winning Player at the email address associated with such players\u2019 Epic account within 7 days of completion of the Event, or such other time as reasonably required by Epic for such notification, and will be subject to verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 3 and compliance with these Rules. &nbsp;A potential Winning Player must keep the Epic account that he or she used to compete in the Event active throughout the verification of eligibility process.<br />\n<br />\nUpon formal notification from Epic, a potential Winning Player shall have 45 days from the date such notice was emailed to respond and provide any information or materials requested by Epic, including the Release (as defined below) for purposes of verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 3. &nbsp;Such response from a potential Winning Player must be delivered to the email address from which Epic\u2019s notification was sent or, at Epic\u2019s sole option, another email address specified in the notification. &nbsp;The date of receipt by Epic shall be decisive for a potential Winning Player\u2019s compliance with the deadlines set forth in this Section 2.6.5.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe failure by any such player to (a) keep the Epic account that he or she used to compete in the Event active throughout the verification of eligibility process or (b) timely respond to any notification or request for materials or information will result in such player\u2019s disqualification as a potential Winning Player, and such player shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event. &nbsp;In such cases, no alternate Winning Player will be named, and Epic shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (y) award any prize amounts that would have otherwise been awarded to such disqualified player as part of a future Game competitive event or (z) donate any such prize amounts to non-profit causes and efforts. &nbsp;A Winning Player will only be announced once the verification of eligibility process has been completed by Epic pursuant to these Rules.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWinning Players will also be required to provide certain payment information to Epic, including any required tax information forms, in order to receive the prizes. Epic may withhold payment of the prizes if the Winning Player fails to provide the applicable payment forms to Epic in a timely manner. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPRIZES ARE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAXES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES) &nbsp;AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH WINNING PLAYER TO (I) CHECK WITH HIS OR HER LOCAL TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE WHICH TAXES APPLY TO HIM OR HER AND (II) PAY SUCH TAXES TO THE APPROPRIATE TAX AUTHORITY. &nbsp;It is Epic's policy to withhold tax at the backup withholding rates in effect for US and non-US residents. &nbsp;Prize income and tax withholding will be reported on forms (y) 1099-MISC for US residents and 1042-S for non-US residents, and (z) any other relevant tax forms as may be required by applicable law. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nEpic will determine the payment method for the prizes in its sole discretion and, except as otherwise required by applicable law, all payments will be made directly to the Winning Player in his or her capacity as an individual (or, if a Minor, to the Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian). &nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, no prize payments will be made by Epic to any organization, company, or other entity. &nbsp;Each Winning Player will be provided a Prize Acceptance and Release Form (\u201cRelease\u201d). &nbsp;Unless restricted by applicable law, each Winning Player (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian) will be required to complete and submit the Release in accordance with the deadlines set forth in this Section 2.6.5.<br />\n<br />\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player Eligibility<br />\n<br />\n3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player Age<br />\n<br />\n3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be eligible to participate in any Champion Series match, a player must be at least 13 years old (or such other age, if greater, as may be required in such player\u2019s country of residence). &nbsp;If a player is under 18 years of age or the age of majority as defined in such player\u2019s country of residence (a \u201cMinor\u201d), such player must have permission from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate in the Event.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ineligible players who mislead or attempt to mislead Event Administrators by providing false eligibility information will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortnite EULA<br />\n<br />\nEach player must follow the Fortnite End User License Agreement (\u201cFortnite EULA\u201d) (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/eula).

Epic and the Event Administrators each may restrict or change team and individual player tags or screen names for any reason.<br />\n<br />\n3.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The name used by a team or player may not include or make use of the&nbsp;<br />\nterms Fortnite\u00ae, Epic, or any other trademark, trade name, or logo owned by or licensed to Epic.<br />\n<br />\n3.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The name used by a team or player cannot be an impersonation of another team, player, streamer, celebrity, government official, Epic employee, or any other person or entity.<br />\n<br />\n3.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Good Standing<br />\n<br />\nPlayers must be in good standing with respect to any Epic accounts registered by said player, with no undisclosed violations.

Players are expressly prohibited from having additional Event entries using additional or secondary Epic account(s), and/or participating from more than one (1) server regions. &nbsp;By way of example only, and not as a limitation, this means that a player is prohibited from participating in the Contender Cup on an alternate account if that player has a separate Epic account that is leveled at a rank eligible for the Champion Cup.<br />\n<br />\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player/Team Formation Rules<br />\n<br />\n4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Trios<br />\n<br />\n4.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each Trios player (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian) must acknowledge and accept these Rules in-game pursuant to Section 1.2 before participating in the Event.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;During the Event, all players on a team must be present and partied up together in order to participate. Players on a team may not play Solo or Duo. If a team does not have all members present and partied up together by the start time for a given match, it will be considered to have finished in (or tied for) last place with zero eliminations for that match.<br />\n<br />\n4.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may only participate on one team at a time throughout each session. If a team qualifies for Stage 2 of the Champion Series, all three (3) players will be jointly locked to that team for that stage, unless they unanimously decide as a team to forfeit their spot for that stage. If a member of a Stage 2 qualified team later qualifies for Stage 2 as a member of a different team, this second qualification will not be valid. In order to make the second qualification valid, all three (3) players on the existing Stage 2 qualified team must submit a written request to disband to tournaments@epicgames.com before the deadline of 1:00 AM ET on October 26, 2020. &nbsp;If such request is approved, the existing Stage 2 qualified team will be removed from the furthest stage previously achieved, and the next in-line team(s) will advance to Stage 2 based on the Leaderboard standings.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n4.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All members of a team that fall within the prizing thresholds set forth in Sections 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, or 2.6.4 (as applicable) must successfully pass the verification of eligibility process described in Section 2.6.5 in order to be eligible to receive such prizes. If one member of a team fails the verification of eligibility process, all members of that team will be disqualified as potential Winning Players, and that team shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event.<br />\n<br />\n4.2.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each member of a team shall be deemed to have jointly and severally made and entered into all of the representations, warranties, and agreements contained herein and shall be jointly and severally obligated and bound thereby. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators\u2019 rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.2.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Qualifier or Grand Finals qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization.<br />\n<br />\n4.2.7 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may only party up with those within the same platform grouping. For clarity, this means that PC players may only queue together with other PC players, and console and mobile players may only queue together with other console and mobile players.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Terms<br />\n<br />\n5.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bug&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAn error, flaw, failure, or fault that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or otherwise causes the Game and/or a hardware device to behave in unintended ways.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to the player\u2019s actions.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from a match without a legitimate reason for doing so.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match).

Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have mislead Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Players are expressly prohibited from having additional Event entries using additional or secondary Epic account(s), and/or participating from more than one (1) server regions. &nbsp;By way of example only, and not as a limitation, this means that a player is prohibited from participating in the Contender Cup on an alternate account if that player has a separate Epic account that is leveled at a rank eligible for the Champion Cup.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player/Team Formation Rules<br />\n<br />\n4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Solos (Platform Cup)<br />\n<br />\n4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each Solo player (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian) must acknowledge and accept these Rules in-game pursuant to Section 1.2 before participating in the Platform Cup.<br />\n<br />\n4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Trios (Contender/Champion Cup)<br />\n<br />\n4.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each Trios player (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian) must acknowledge and accept these Rules in-game pursuant to Section 1.2 before participating in the Event.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;During the Event, all players on a team must be present and partied up together in order to participate.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player\u2019s receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have mislead Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match).

All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have mislead Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution.

         "content": "<p>Hey Fortnite competitors!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With last week\u2019s arrival of Season 4, we wanted to share what you can expect on the competitive front this season \u2014 including the new Hype leaderboard, upcoming tournaments, rule clarifications, enforcement policies, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 4 Hype Leaderboard</h2>\n\n<p>In case you missed it, we\u2019ve built a <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/hype-leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\">global Hype leaderboard</a> that updates in real time.</p>\n\n<p>Keep an eye out for your favorite Fortnite players and rising stars.</p>\n\n<h2>Upcoming Fortnite Tournaments</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re making adjustments to our tournament offerings this season&nbsp;to keep things fresh. We\u2019re also working to better incorporate third-party tournaments (like Dreamhack) to avoid overlapping with other major tournaments.</p>\n\n<p>Below is the current schedule for the first weeks of Chapter 2 - Season 4 competitive play.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Fortnite Tournament Lineup So Far</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Season 4 Hype Cup -</strong> September 6<br />\n<strong>September Dreamhack Online Open (NA-West) - </strong>September 12 - September 13<br />\n<strong>Hype Nite -</strong> September 13<br />\n<strong>Paradox\u2019s Platform Solo Cash Cups: </strong>Every Monday from September 14 - September 21<br />\n<strong>Castor\u2019s Contender Trios Cash Cups: </strong>Every Tuesday from September 15 - September 22<br />\n<strong>Chopper\u2019s Champion Trios Cash Cups:</strong> Every Tuesday from September 15 - September 22<br />\n<strong>Wild Wednesdays:</strong> Every Wednesday from September 16 - September 23<br />\n<strong>Hype Nite: </strong>Every Sunday from September 20 - September 27<br />\n<strong>September Dreamhack Online Open (NA-East)</strong> - September 17 - September 18<br />\n<strong>September Dreamhack Online Open (Europe) </strong>- September 19 - September 20<br />\n<strong>FNCS Warmup: </strong>September 25 - September 27</p>\n\n<p>Wild Wednesdays will be prized LTM tournaments, changing up each week! We\u2019re also planning on slotting more pop-up tournaments and third party events not listed here that will complement these offerings.</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS: Chapter 2 - Season 4</h2>\n\n<p>The Fortnite Champion Series returns, is your Trio ready? We continue to iterate on the format, drawing on some of the learnings that came from last season\u2019s experimental format. This season, the final round of each Weekly Qualifier will feature the same 33-team group playing over two days, and for the Grand Finals we\u2019re introducing a new <strong>Wildcard Match</strong> for determining the last qualifying team from the Group Stage!<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ll be keeping an eye on in-game performance and the impact of various new gameplay elements. We\u2019ll make sure to confirm which will be present in Competitive playlists before the FNCS season begins. Our enhanced viewer site at watch.fortnite.com also continues to evolve as we continue with our official broadcast, supported by Twitch Drops for viewers on that platform.</p>\n\n<p><u>FNCS Dates</u><br />\nFNCS Week 1: October 9 - October 11<br />\nFNCS Week 2: October 16 - October 18<br />\nFNCS Week 3: October 23 - October 25<br />\nFNCS Finals: October 29 - November 1</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ll have more to share for FNCS, including complete details and official rules, at a later date.</p>\n\n<h2>Official Rules Clarifications</h2>\n\n<p>As we mentioned last week in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-integrity-update\" target=\"_blank\">competitive integrity update</a>, we\u2019d like to highlight a few rules and offer clarity for Chapter 2 - Season 4 along with a few updates.</p>\n\n<h3>Collusion</h3>\n\n<h4>What is collusion (not an exhaustive list):</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Consistently working together with the same opponent. This includes fighting together or working together against a 3rd player or 3rd team who encroaches on a shared location or shared drop spot.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>With this clarification now in place, we\u2019re now taking a greater stand to action if conclusive evidence is found linking opponents to common goals together.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Staged engagements among colluding teams to deceive event admins. As an example: Manipulating storm surge factors intentionally by trading damage with no intent of elimination.</li>\n\t<li>Pickaxe swinging (or other actions) used as a form of <a href=\"https://epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/signaling-update-competitive-fortnite-2020\">signaling</a> to opponents.</li>\n\t<li>Sharing loot or leaving items with or for opponents for their gain.</li>\n\t<li>Intentionally feeding eliminations to another team.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>What isn\u2019t collusion (not an exhaustive list):&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Consistently dropping in the same location each match.</li>\n\t<li>Announcing a drop spot on social media.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>If you believe you're good enough to stake your claim publicly on a spot, be prepared to defend it. Players contesting your claim is part of the game, and should be encouraged.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Choosing to not engage in combat at certain times.</li>\n\t<li>Coaching using the in-game replay tools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Outright competitive bans will be made when the collusion evidence is conclusive, without any official warnings. Warnings will be issued in situations when players are very close to the line of collusion, and we will administer these in cases that could swing either way. Continued actions after official warnings could then result in competitive bans.</p>\n\n<p>Reminder: <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-updates---chapter-2-season-3\" target=\"_blank\">Players actioned for 30 days or longer during last season will not be eligible for this season\u2019s FNCS</a>. We are continuing this policy for Season 4; any players removed from competitions for 30 days or longer will be ineligible to participate in next season's pinnacle event.</p>\n\n<h3>Smurfing or Illegal Restarts</h3>\n\n<p>Like last season, smurfing is still disallowed in most prized competitions. We\u2019re splitting the current definition of smurfing into two parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Traditional Smurfing: Playing on an alternate account that has a lower Arena Rank than your main account in order to illegally participate in tournaments or events that are only eligible for lower Arena Ranks. This type of smurfing will not be allowed in any official tournaments that are only open to those in lower Arena ranks.</li>\n\t<li>Illegal Restarts: Playing on an alternate account AND a main account in the same tournament window. This type of smurfing will not be allowed in any official tournaments, unless otherwise indicated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>3rd Party Software</h3>\n\n<p>3rd party aim assist software is never allowed. Players detected using this will be removed from Fortnite competitions and issued competitive bans.</p>\n\n<h3>Clout Farming</h3>\n\n<p>This season, we will now be taking action against anyone who falsely promotes themselves as a banned or cheating player. This false information gets in the way of real investigations that action true bad actors. It also goes against the spirit of the game and Fortnite competition, which has no place within the competitive Fortnite community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Technical Issues</h3>\n\n<p>This season, we\u2019re also modifying an older rule involving Technical Issues. Due to the nature and scale of online competition, we previously had a hard rule of not restarting or making matches null due to server crashes. While this will still be the case for the majority of online competitions, we are improving this rule to include&nbsp;any matches or tournaments that specifically use scheduled matchmaking (like FNCS Finals, or any sessions with only 100 players or less). This will give the Epic Competitive team more flexibility to make the best decision based on the factors at hand for any unfortunate scenarios (like a complete server crash) in single lobby events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Let\u2019s Go!</h2>\n\n<p>Remember, prized tournaments will start two weeks after the season launches to let the meta settle. Until then, hop in Arena to explore the new changes and climb the Hype Leaderboard. Stay tuned for updates on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive\">@FNCompetitive</a> on Twitter, and good luck this Season!</p>\n<br />\n- The Fortnite Competitive Team&nbsp;",

Any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player\u2019s score at the conclusion of such player\u2019s participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player\u2019s receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering<br />\nPlayers shall not not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have mislead Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

         "content": "<h1>Fortnite Competitive Integrity Update</h1>\nHey all,<br />\n<br />\nRecently there\u2019s been an uptick in community conversations around cheating and bad actors within the Fortnite Competitive ecosystem. We wanted to address some of these concerns by restating our goals, providing some insight into recent events, sharing some of our future plans, and asking for your help.<br />\n<br />\nOur goal is to maintain the highest level of competitive integrity possible, while operating at a massive scale. Hosting fair and open tournaments in a free-to-play game is a huge undertaking, and we\u2019re always working to improve. Ensuring a positive experience for players means catching bad actors and taking action swiftly!&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>FNCS Delays in Action</h2>\nRecently we discovered an error in our internal systems that resulted in our automatic detections and actioning being delayed. Regardless of the error, the cheaters were eventually caught by our AntiCheat and banned automatically. This error has been corrected and all automatic actionings are functioning &nbsp;in near-real time again. Additionally, all of the accounts detected cheating during FNCS this season were disqualified and actioned appropriately.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>A New Way to Report Suspicious Player Activity</h2>\nWe\u2019ve also created a new form located <a href=\"https://fnac.questionpro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> where players can report suspicious activity, and provide the necessary evidence for us to investigate. Any reports received in this manner will be reviewed in line with our process for all incoming reports. While we won\u2019t respond directly to these submissions, you can be assured that we take every valid report seriously. Any perceived lack of action towards reported players generally means one of two things: either we\u2019re still actively investigating and want to make sure we take the time to make the correct decision based on the facts, or we\u2019ve determined the player in question did not violate the rules.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWith Chapter 2 - Season 4 on the horizon, we are also reviewing our official rules for next season\u2019s offerings and internal policies. We want to be more transparent about specific rules, so competing players never wonder if something is crossing a line or not. We\u2019re planning to release &nbsp;an update about those changes before the next FNCS season begins.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>How You Can Help</h2>\nYour actions matter. We need your help to create a better competitive ecosystem.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSome things to remember:<br />\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Player\u2019s accomplishments should be celebrated. Bullying is never acceptable and a violation of our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/community-rules?sessionInvalidated=true\" target=\"_blank\">Community Rules</a>. Use the in-game reporting tools - in live games or in replays - or the new submission form <a href=\"https://fnac.questionpro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to report issues. These are the best ways to get eyes on potential bad actors quickly.</li>\n\t<li>Celebrating cheaters is damaging to the entire ecosystem. If you are a member of Support-a-Creator and create content that encourages cheating, you will be removed from the program.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThanks for helping us support fair play in Fortnite!<br />\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-The Fortnite Team</div>\n",

Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have mislead Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control, corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match throwing or fixing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from a match without a legitimate reason for doing so.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). &nbsp;For clarity, a player\u2019s receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering<br />\n<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify Event Organizer or an Event Administrator.

Without limitation of the foregoing, Epic, at its sole discretion, may monitor the Event and enforce any applicable punishment specified in these Rules, Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, and/or the Fortnite EULA.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, the disqualification of a player or the enforcement of any applicable punishment by Event Organizer and/or Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Event Organizer or Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Event Organizer and/or Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer has binding authority to decide all player disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Event Organizer and Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Epic events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nEXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND AS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PLAYER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES (OR, IF A MINOR, SUCH PLAYER\u2019S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES ON SUCH PLAYER\u2019S BEHALF) ANY RIGHT S/HE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, ANY PRIZE AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.<br />\n<br />\n13. &nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\n<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

(\u201cEpic\u201d) to allow individuals and organizations to organize and administer their own events featuring competitive play of the Game (collectively, \u201cCommunity Events\u201d). For clarity, while Epic may provide prizes for the Event and the Community Events, such events are not \u201cofficial\u201d Epic-run events and neither the Event nor any other Community Event is sponsored or administered by Epic. Players must look to Bugha or Nyhrox/Aqua respectively (\u201cEvent Organizer\u201d) for any questions or dispute resolutions in connection with the Event.

For Round 2, the first match will start fifteen (15) minutes after the session window begins. &nbsp;Each Round 2 session will last approximately three (3) hours, with a new match starting every thirty (30) minutes.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (\u201cToxic Behavior\u201d).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match throwing or fixing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person\u2019s name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player\u2019s connection to the Game\u2019s game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from a match without a legitimate reason for doing so.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players\u2019 health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). &nbsp;For clarity, a player\u2019s receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering<br />\n<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n<br />\n8.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify Event Organizer or an Event Administrator. If Event Organizer witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct, Event Organizer should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator at tournaments@epicgames.com. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player or Event Organizer for bringing forward a complaint or cooperating in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by Event Organizer, Event Administrators, Epic, or each of their respective affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer is authorized to make decisions regarding violations of these Rules in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review. If Event Organizer decides that a player has violated these Rules (including the Code of Conduct), Event Organizer may disqualify the player from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Without limitation of the foregoing, Epic, at its sole discretion, may monitor the Event and enforce any applicable punishment specified in these Rules, Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, and/or the Fortnite EULA.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, the disqualification of a player or the enforcement of any applicable punishment by Event Organizer and/or Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Event Organizer or Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Event Organizer and/or Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer has binding authority to decide all player disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Event Organizer which shall be binding, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Event Organizer and Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player or Event Organizer for bringing forward a complaint or cooperating in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by Event Organizer, Event Administrators, Epic, or each of their respective affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer is authorized to make decisions regarding violations of these Rules in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.

Without limitation of the foregoing, Epic, at its sole discretion, may monitor the Event and enforce any applicable punishment specified in these Rules, Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, and/or the Fortnite EULA.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, the disqualification of a player or the enforcement of any applicable punishment by Event Organizer and/or Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Event Organizer or Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Event Organizer and/or Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer has binding authority to decide all player disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such player\u2019s behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Event Organizer which shall be binding, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Event Organizer and Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Epic events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nEXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND AS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PLAYER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES (OR, IF A MINOR, SUCH PLAYER\u2019S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES ON SUCH PLAYER\u2019S BEHALF) ANY RIGHT S/HE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, ANY PRIZE AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.<br />\n<br />\n13. &nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\n<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic\u2019s final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party\u2019s control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event.

Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic\u2019s control, corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic\u2019s privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a9 2020 Epic Games, Inc.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic\u2019s Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player\u2019s parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player\u2019s behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

         "content": "Hello Fortnite competitors!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWith the arrival of Fortnite Chapter 2 - Season 3, we\u2019re ready to discuss what you can expect on the competitive front this Season \u2014 including tournaments, new rules, enforcement policies, and more.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Fortnite Official Broadcasts</h2>\nWith last Season\u2019s FNCS Invitational, we wanted to see if we could bring back the official broadcast with a completely remote, socially-distanced production team. Given all of the positive feedback we received, we will continue to broadcast our FNCS tournaments this year while highlighting new and rising on-screen talent during these broadcasts.<br />\n<br />\nEach season of FNCS broadcasts will also include more Competitive-themed Twitch drops. In an effort to better support community-led viewing experiences, we\u2019ll be making these drops available to any Twitch channel streaming FNCS gameplay.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Fortnite Seasonal Items Update</h2>\nWith the Season 3 launch, we wanted to provide a reminder on how we\u2019re handling Season launches and new items in Fortnite. When a new Season drops, core playlists and Arena will contain the same items. As new items are added throughout the season, there will be a two week evaluation period where new items are kept out of Arena and tournaments. If it is felt new item(s) will add value to competitive play, they may be added to the Arena and tournament pool after the evaluation period. In rare cases, some items may also be subject to change over the course of the season, as was seen with Remote Explosives and Grenades last Season. This philosophy only applies to items specifically and does not necessarily apply to map updates or environmental changes.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Fortnite Competitive Integrity Updates</h2>\nWhether you\u2019re a new or returning player to Fortnite Competitive, we encourage everyone to make sure they understand our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/rules-library\" target=\"_blank\">rules for competitive play</a>. With Chapter 2 - Season 3, we are introducing a few new guidelines:<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Future Event Eligibility Policy</h3>\nWe are updating our event eligibility policy. If a player is caught breaking an official rule that results in a 30-day or longer competitive ban, that player will also be ineligible for the next Season\u2019s FNCS (or other pinnacle event), regardless of competitive ban timing.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Multiple Accounts and \u201cSmurfing\u201d</h3>\nEffective immediately, players will not be permitted to play in the same session\u2019s tournament across multiple accounts. This includes restarting a tournament on a different account to gain an unfair advantage, or having multiple players participate on the same machine.<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, this season we will have some Cash Cups broken out by Arena level. Any instances of \u201csmurfing\u201d (playing on a secondary account that has a lower rank than your main account) in the lower level tournaments will result in actions against both your main account and smurf account.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Display Name Policy</h3>\nPart of our broadcast goals is to share Fortnite competitions with a globally diverse viewer base. It is our responsibility to make sure that all parts of our broadcast are living-room safe, including the display names of all competitors. Any player who has a questionable display name is required to change it now, or will be disqualified from current tournaments and ineligible for the next season\u2019s FNCS depending on severity or repeated rule breaks.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Fortnite Season 3 Competitive Tournament Schedule*</h2>\nHere\u2019s the current schedule for Chapter 2 - Season 3 competitive play:<br />\n<br />\nContender-Only Trios Cash Cups: Every Wednesday from July 15 - August 12<br />\nChampion-Only Trios Cash Cups: Every Wednesday from July 15 - August 12<br />\nPlatform Cash Cups: Every Thursday from July 16 - August 13<br />\nHype Nite: Every Sunday from July 19 - August 16<br />\nFNCS Qualifier 1: August 1<br />\nFNCS Qualifier 2: August 2<br />\nFNCS Qualifier 3: August 8<br />\nFNCS Qualifier 4: August 9<br />\nFNCS Finals: August 14 - August 16<br />\n<br />\n<em>*All dates are subject to change</em><br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Dreamhack Online Tournaments featuring Fortnite</h2>\nWe are continuing to build out our competitive ecosystem and expanding competitive options for players with a partnership with Dreamhack. The first competition will be the Dreamhack Open featuring Fortnite starting in July with more online tournaments being scheduled for the rest of 2020. More info on what is coming is in Dreamhack\u2019s press release is <a href=\"https://news.cision.com/dreamhack/r/dreamhack-announces-dreamhack-open-featuring-fortnite-tournament-series,c3139134\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Note</strong>: The Epic team will be taking time off from July 3 to July 12. There will be no tournaments with prizes during these dates.<br />\n<br />\nOutside of the schedule above, we &nbsp;are also planning additional activations across all regions for even more opportunities to hop in and compete. Keep an eye on the Compete tab in-game and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fncompetitive\" target=\"_blank\">@FNCompetitive</a> for updates!<br />\n<br />\nGood luck this Season!<br />\n&nbsp;",

         "content": "Happy New Year Fortnite Competitors,<br />\n<br />\nThroughout 2019, our competitive and anti-cheat teams worked together to remove players from tournaments and Arena who broke our Competitive Code of Conduct or any other official rules pertaining to Fortnite competitions. Our primary goal is to support competition that is fun, inclusive, and in line with the overall spirit of Fortnite. Unsportsmanlike conduct from participants is not within that spirit, and will not be tolerated in Fortnite competition.\n<h2><br />\n2020 Competitive Integrity</h2>\n\n<p>For 2020 and beyond, our team will continue to monitor competitive play in all regions and will take action against unfair play if necessary. With this new year of Fortnite competition, we wanted to highlight a specific rule and provide clarification on what we will be actioning on moving forward:<br />\n<br />\nCompetitive Fortnite\u2019s Collusion Rule:<br />\n<br />\n<em>Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d). Examples of Collusion include the following:</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Teaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.</em><br />\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><em>Planned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific</em>\u00a0<em>locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.</em><br />\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>Communication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to\u00a0</em><em>communicate with opposing players.\u00a0</em></strong><br />\n\t\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><em>Item Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThroughout last year, players have been sending or receiving signals more commonly during official Fortnite competitions to the point where many players are confused around the ruling.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nFor 2020 (starting <strong>1/20/20</strong>), we are taking action against any kind of in-game communication between opponents via signaling in official tournament matches. This includes, but is not limited to:\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pick-axe swinging</li>\n\t<li>Emoting</li>\n\t<li>Toy tossing</li>\n\t<li>Jumping</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nAny cases of signaling like those listed above will now result in a teaming/collusion penalty. We want to be explicitly clear that pacifism-style gameplay is still allowed, but if signaling is involved, we will review and take appropriate action for the teaming/collusion penalty. Repeat offenders may be subject to increased penalties.\n<h2><br />\nIf You See Something, Say Something</h2>\n\n<p>Remember, if you do have a competitive integrity issue that you\u2019d like to report please contact us through our <a href=\"https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/epic-games-competitive/?contact=1\">player support team</a>. They\u2019ll help to make sure that your inquiry will end up in the right place.<br />\n\u00a0<br />\nYou can also report players in-game for cheating, exploitation, harassment, and more. \u00a0Your reports are instrumental in helping us identify potential bad folks quickly - we appreciate you taking the time to submit those reports.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n",

Millions of you hopped on the Battle Bus to play in the three day competition, with over 45,000 players walking away with cash rewards.<br />\n<br />\nThe Winter Royale 2019 Leaderboards are now final as we have addressed all remaining Leaderboard issues, including:<br />\n\u00a0\n<h3>Leaderboard Issues</h3>\n<br />\n1)\u00a0ISSUE - Players encountered instances where one player had a disconnect before getting into a match and those points did not count for the sole remaining player. Per the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/2019-winter-royale-official-rules\">Official Rules</a>, a match still counts even if the full team is not able to load in together.<br />\n<br />\nSOLUTION - To solve this issue, we ran a Leaderboard repair after the conclusion of the series, so any points that may have originally appeared lost due to playing as a Solo player now are applied to your Duo on the Leaderboard. We\u2019re currently working on a fix for the incomplete team issue, and are aiming to have it corrected before the next major tournament series kicks off.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n2)\u00a0ISSUE - As an additional side effect of the disconnected player repair, some teams were able to play more than the 15-match maximum for each individual series.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nSOLUTION - When this was discovered, we had to wipe the Leaderboards completely and proceed with an additional full repair which resulted in any matches played over the 15 matches limit in a single series being invalid.<br />\n<br />\nDue to the holidays and the time required to process the issues detailed above, we apologize that our communication and prize processing have been slower than we would like. We have now successfully uploaded prizes to the payment portal, and potential Winter Royale 2019 winners have been contacted via the email associated with their Epic Games account. Check this email for next steps on how to start the prize verification process.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThanks again for a great Winter Royale and Winterfest, and we\u2019ll see you on the Battle Bus!<br />\n<br />\n- The Fortnite Competitive Team",

         "title": "What\u2019s New for Competitive in Chapter 2",
         "content": "<h1>Chapter 2 Season 1 Arena</h1>\n<br />\nWith a new Season (and Chapter!) comes a full Hype reset in Arena Mode. As before, Arena will continue to mirror the focus of Fortnite Champion Series this season, with Squads Arena available now. Like last season, Solo Arena will also be available. Climb to Champion League to unlock Fortnite Champion Series tournaments.\n<h1>Fortnite Champion Series Update</h1>\n<br />\nThe Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) returns next month and will continue the seasonal cadence of Competitive Fortnite. Starting on November 1, there will be a three-round Squads event each weekend for four weeks. Similar to last season, we will be advancing the top teams each week from each region to the Chapter 2 Season 1 Finals. We will continue to award Series Points based on each team\u2019s final placement every week during the FNCS to determine team placement on the Series Leaderboard. Like before, the top performers on this leaderboard will also advance to the Season Finals.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re making some small adjustments this season. For Chapter 2 Season 1, we\u2019re moving more qualification spots to the individual weekly qualifiers, and will source fewer teams from the Series Leaderboard. Our goals here are to 1) give players more opportunities to play with different squads without totally harming their chances of qualification and 2) retain the value of consistent competitive play over the course of the season for the squads who wish to remain together. Additionally, trades will not be allowed between any qualified teams.<br />\n<br />\nThe Season Finals will be held online for each region on December 6 - 8 to determine who will be crowned the Chapter 2 Season 1 Champions.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThis Season, we\u2019ll be giving away $5,000,000 in total prizes across all regions and competitions, including weekly Cash Cups and new platform specific tournaments.\n<h1>FNCS Warmup</h1>\n<br />\nThe weekend before the start of FNCS, we will hold an FNCS Warmup. This will be a non-cash practice tournament. Hop in with your squad to try new rotations, sharpen your skills, and prepare for this Season\u2019s competitive kick off!\u00a0\n<h1>Audio Improvements</h1>\n<br />\nWith the release of Chapter 2, we\u2019re excited to share that we\u2019ve added a setting to improve audio. Tested by members of the competitive community, by toggling on the \u201c3D Headphones\u201d mode in the Audio Options menu, the mode will improve spatialization of tactically-important sounds.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWhat does that mean? You\u2019ll have a better sense of sounds above, below, and behind you! Please note: we recommend stereo headphones for this mode, and the mode will not work if you have the \u201cVisualize Sound Effects\u201d accessibility option enabled. Jump in and try it out!<br />\n\u00a0\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDUbxKGb2nY\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n",

Upon discovering this, we rebuilt and corrected the leaderboards. We are working on updating our automated systems to fix these issues, and will keep a close eye on this for subsequent competitions.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday of the FNCS Finals, we experienced technical issues with our new scheduled matchmaking system - designed to automatically drop trios into their matches every 30 minutes. We were able to resolve them late Friday night. While these issues did not impact the competition itself, we appreciate players\u2019 patience as we worked through them.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nDespite these issues, we believe the new matchmaking is a great improvement over the previous system. Compared with past online events, our matchmaking is now much more efficient, allowing us to run 29 total rounds of competition in a single weekend, featuring over 2,000 players across seven global server regions! We\u2019re excited about the potential of this feature for future events.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWith the inaugural season of the FNCS now over, we want to thank all of you who played, watched, and cheered along with us. Thank you all for helping to make this series great, we\u2019ll see you on the Battle Bus!",

         "content": "<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Last Week to Qualify for FNCS Season X Finals</strong></span><br />\n<br />\nThis upcoming weekend is the last opportunity for players to qualify for the Fortnite Champion Series Finals! Qualifying can be done in one of two ways:\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Weekend\u2019s Top Teams</strong><br />\nThe first way to qualify is to be one of the top performing teams for this weekend. In order to be eligible, all players must have reached Champion league in the Arena during Season X. Then, compete in your region\u2019s qualifier this weekend. The top 4 or 8 teams (depending on region size) will earn an automatic qualification into the Heats.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<strong>FNCS Points</strong><br />\nThe second way is by earning a spot is through consistency in all qualifier weekends. This is determined by the amount of FNCS points your team has earned. This weekend is your last chance to earn these points to push your Trio into one of these spots. Drop in this weekend for the last chance to try and earn your team\u2019s place!\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe finals will begin on Friday, September 20th, with the top teams in every region battling it out for their chance to be crowned the first ever Season Champions.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Ziplines Disabled</strong></span><br />\nOn September 6th, we disabled ziplines on the map due to an issue. We\u2019ve since identified a fix for this and are working to roll it out during our next game update. For the time being, Ziplines will remain disabled, so you should keep that in mind when planning your rotations, inventory, and drop spots heading into the final qualifying week of FNCS.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nNote: Depending on your in-game graphic and game settings, Ziplines could still be visible at far-away distances. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Qualified Players: Team Trading & Disbanding Rules</strong></span><br />\nAs we head into the final qualifying week of the FNCS, we\u2019ve been seeing in increase in questions from qualified players about how to swap teammates or create a new Trio team. So here\u2019s an overview of how forming a new trio and swapping players work.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rule 4.2.2:</strong><br />\n<em>Players may only participate on one team at a time throughout each session. If a team qualifies for Stage 2 of the Fortnite Champion Series, all players will be jointly locked for that stage, unless they unanimously decide as a team to forfeit their spot for that stage. If a qualified team wants to play again with different partners (i.e., form a new team), all players involved will be removed from the furthest stage previously achieved.</em><br />\n<br />\nThis means that all qualified players are locked into a Trio unless they wish to disband their team. Disbanding a qualified team would require for all 3 of the players to each send an email unanimously agreeing to this. Players must email <u>tournaments@epicgames.com</u> with the subject line \u201cFNCS Disband\u201d from the email associated with their Epic games account to complete this action.<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, qualified teams have the ability to perform a one time trade with other qualified teams, per rule 4.27<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rule 4.27</strong><br />\n<em>Without limiting Section 4.2.2, teams that qualify for the Season Finals may perform a one-time trade of one of their players with another single player from a different team that has also qualified for the Season Finals within the same region. \u00a0This trade must occur before the trade deadline prior to the start of the Group Stage on September 17, 2019 at 11:00 PM EST. \u00a0All six (6) involved players must unanimously agree and request the trade by contacting an Event Administrator, reachable via email at tournaments@epicgames.com.</em><br />\n<br />\nThis means that if two teams who have already qualified would like to exchange a player, they must have all 6 players send separate emails to tournaments@epicgames.com with the details of the trade. Please use the subject line \u201cFNCS Trade\u201d for this type of communication. If these actions are performed then the one time trade will be approved. You can find all the rules for the FNCS <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-champion-series-season-x-official-rules\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\nPlayers who have not already qualified may freely swap team members without contacting Epic for approval. However, each new set of three players is classified as its own unique team, and points from a different set of three players will not carry over.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe look forward to seeing all the amazing moments, comebacks, and stories that are created in this weekend\u2019s final chance to qualify for the FNCS finals. Dive into the action and compete for your team\u2019s spot! For up-to-date information on all things competitive, follow us on Twitter at @FNCompetitive.",

Additionally, if you are under 18 or the age of majority where you live, you must have permission from your parent or legal guardian to participate (their assistance will also be needed when attempting to claim any prizing).<br />\n<br />\nAnyone participating in an event who does not meet the age requirements mentioned above will be disqualified from that event. Any prize or points associated with that event and all previous ones you may have been awarded will be forfeit.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Team Disqualifications</strong><br />\nOn the topic of disqualification, if any member of your team is disqualified from an event for any reason, then the entire team will be disqualified for that event. All team members will lose any prize or points in connection with that event.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Two-Factor Authentication Requirements</strong><br />\nRemember to turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) as all of our competitive events require all participants to have it enabled. If it\u2019s disabled, the game will block you from queueing up for an event.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve been seeing people run into this issue more often in the past few weeks, so if you need some help getting this set up, please refer to <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/2fa?sessionInvalidated=true\">our official instructions on how to enable 2FA here.</a><br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re ever unsure of anything, please refer back to the official rules that are posted online for every event. You can review the rules for Season X Cash Cups <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/season-x-cash-cups-official-rules?sessionInvalidated=true\">here.</a> Find all the rules for the Fortnite Champion Series: Trios events <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-champion-series-season-x-official-rules\">here.</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px;\">Competitive Payments Update</span></strong><br />\nIn the past few months we\u2019ve been implementing a new payment system through which the vast majority of our payments are now handled. We will be continuing to improve this process to be more clear and transparent for players.<br />\n<br />\nSeason X Cash Cup and FNCS prize winners should expect updates on their prizes soon as we work through our final internal steps to verify all required information. Please see our payment status charts below for the latest updates.<br />\n<br />\nAs always, if there are any payment related questions, please reach out to competitive-payments@epicgames.com<br

         "content": "<h2>Fortnite Champion Series Broadcast Plan</h2>\nThe Fortnite Champion Series starts all across the globe from this Friday, August 16 until Saturday, August 17. Find the exact times for your region within the Compete tab in-game. With its debut, we want to outline our coverage plan for these events. For the qualifiers, players will be able to tune in to their favorite streamers during the competition, and we\u2019ll be highlighting some of the best content on official Fortnite streaming and social channels. We\u2019ll also be moving away from official weekend broadcasts in favor of content recaps dropping throughout the following week.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nOur recaps will use server replay functionality to highlight key moments during the competition including commentary from some familiar faces. Sund0wn, Zeke, Ballatw, and Shyowager will be following the stories of top performers and key players in the community. Keep an eye out on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fncompetitive\">FNCompetitive Twitter</a> for more news!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rules and Prizing</strong><br />\nFor all information on rules, prizes, and other information visit the (<a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-champion-series-season-x-official-rules\">Fortnite Champion Series - Season X Official Rules</a>).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Where to Tune In?</strong><br />\nWe\u2019ll be hosting different competitors throughout the tournament that you can tune into at <a href=\"http://twitch.tv/fortnite\">Twitch.tv/Fortnite</a>. Be sure to also stay tuned on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fncompetitive\">FNCompetitive Twitter</a> for updates during the competition.\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2>What are Server Replays?</h2>\nServer replay functionality is what was used to broadcast the Fortnite World Cup Online Open Qualifiers, and now it\u2019s in your hands! The difference between server replays and local replays is that server replays contain information on the entire island and all players for a given match. Gone are the days where you can only see the immediate area around you. Now you can view the action happening anywhere in the match.<br />\n<br />\nFind your favorite player, get unique angles and wide shots, or put on a full-scale broadcast of your own! To access server replays, go to the compete tab in the Lobby and select the event you wish to view. From here, every player on the leaderboard can be selected in order to gather footage.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nHere are some helpful tips when using replays:\n<ul>\n\t<li>You have to act fast, Replays will become unusable when new patches are pushed.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>This does not include Content Updates.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>When a match is live, you\u2019ll see a red bubble next to the player\u2019s name.</li>\n\t<li>You can view other region\u2019s gameplay by going into the settings menu and changing your region.</li>\n\t<li>Setting your Depth of field low will help you find your current focus point when setting your focus manually in the lens setting.</li>\n\t<li>If you find your camera in the storm, you can remove the purple filter with the \"Storm Effects\" Option in the camera settings.</li>\n\t<li>Establishing a wide shot first before moving right into the action helps gives the viewer more information to aid in following the action.</li>\n</ul>\nShare your content using the #FNCS hashtag for a chance to be featured on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fncompetitive\">FNCompetitive Twitter</a>.\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2>Middle East Servers</h2>\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that Arena Mode is now available on our new Middle East (ME) servers that launched this past week! Find out more information on the Middle East server launch <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/announcing-the-middle-east-server-region\">here</a>. Many players in the southern Middle East will see significantly better ping, with more improvements to come as we expand our coverage to more internet service providers (ISPs) in more countries.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe recommend using the Auto setting when selecting your region since even though you may be geographically closest to the Middle East, some players will still have a better experience playing in Europe depending on your location and ISP. Drop-in now and get your practice in before the Fortnite Champion Series starts on Friday, August 16.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe top four teams will also qualify for the Season Finals to be held from September 20 - September 22.<br />\n<br />\nFor more details on the Fortnite Champion Series, you can read last week\u2019s competitive blog <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/season-x-competitive-launch-update\">here.</a>\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0",

         "content": "<strong>Fortnite Champion Series</strong><br />\nThe Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS) kicks off next week and will be the next step in competitive Fortnite for 2019. Starting on August 17, there will be a three-round Trios event each weekend for five weeks. Similar to how we ran the Fortnite World Cup Online Opens, we will be advancing the top teams each week from each region to the Season X Finals. With the FNCS, however, we\u2019ll also provide a new path to qualify for the Season Finals. Series Points will be awarded based on each team\u2019s final placement every week during the FNCS to determine team placement on the Series Leaderboard. The top performers on this leaderboard will also advance to the Season Finals. This format values consistency over the course of the season, but still rewards the outstanding performance players make when competing in individual weeks. The Season Finals will be held online for each region on September 20 - 22 to determine who will be crowned the Season X Champions.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nFor Season X, we\u2019ll be giving away $10 million across all regions and competitions within the FNCS. We also have more practice opportunities and prizes up for grabs in separate Solo and Trios Cash Cups taking place Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday each week. You can expect a full breakdown of the official rules early next week. We are excited to see how this season of competitive Fortnite plays out!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TL;DR</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>$10,000,000+ in prizing\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>The mode of choice will be Trios</li>\n\t<li>Dedicated prize pools each weekend as well as a chance to qualify for the Season X Championship</li>\n\t<li>Top teams in each server region will face off on September 20-22 where we\u2019ll crown the Season X Champions</li>\n\t<li>2 Factor Authentication is required to be enabled for all rounds in each tournament for Season X. If you need to add this to your account, follow our 2FA instructions here: <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/2fa\">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/2fa</a>. The email used for 2FA will be the same one we use for all potential winner communication.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>B.R.U.T.E. </strong><br />\nWe\u2019ve been monitoring the impact of the B.R.U.T.E. in gameplay and are investigating ways to enhance combat feedback when interacting with the vehicle. In v10.10, we will add a targeting laser that will show the direction the B.R.U.T.E. is aiming its rockets while they are being charged. This laser will have directional audio to help indicate when it\u2019s being pointed at you, even if you\u2019re behind a structure. We\u2019ve also fixed a few mobility bugs that was allowing players to exploit its boost mechanic.<br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\nThe B.R.U.T.E. remains within the core game modes (Solo, Duos, and Squads), select Limited Time Modes, and in competitive Arena and Tournament play. We\u2019ll communicate any future iterations to the vehicle as we\u2019re continuing to investigate a few more areas where we can improve combat interactions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Arena Bug Fix</strong><br />\nFrom Thursday, August 1 until Monday, August 5, there was an issue that caused the Arena playlist to use Season 9 matchmaking buckets instead of Season 10. This meant that due to the refactor in scoring, players were not being appropriately matched into the correct skill buckets, causing there to be little differentiation in skill levels. We pushed out a hotfix and were able to get this resolved, so players should see an increase in game quality, but some might see their queue times increase due to the change.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Payments Update</strong><br />\nLast week we updated everyone <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/competitive-payments-update-new-payment-system\">here</a> about the progress that has been made using our new payment system. We\u2019ve seen a lot of new players start the verification process and successfully see their prize distributed to their Hyperwallet account.\u00a0\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\nToday, August 9, we will contact players for Online Open Weeks 7-10 to begin the eligibility and tax verification/payment process with the goal of contacting Xbox Cup and Trios Cup players next week. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWith a new system and new players experiencing the system for the first time, we want to make sure we provide tips on how to complete the process efficiently and touch on some rare cases that some players experience due to their country of residence.\u00a0\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<em>The four tips this week are:</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Accuracy of your Information</strong> - We continue to see incorrect or incomplete information provided in the Tax Interview portion of the process that begins at epicgames.com/competitive. If you are a minor (under 18 years of age, or as otherwise determined by your country of residence) your parent or legal guardian must complete the required sections.\u00a0 The next step of setting up a Hyperwallet account will be blocked if this is not completed correctly.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hyperwallet accounts set up</strong> - If you are a minor, your parent or legal guardian will also need to set up the Hyperwallet account using the same email provided during the Tax Interview process. If there are any inaccuracies or inconsistencies, Hyperwallet may require additional documentation to verify a potential payee\u2019s identity or close their account.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Safari Browser Errors</strong> - We are aware of an issue that blocks epicgames.com/competitive on Safari browsers for desktop and mobile. As we explore this issue, we suggest players use a different browser to complete their Tax Interview. We also suggest completing the Tax Interview on a desktop when possible.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\t</style>\n\t<strong>Original Payment System Prizes</strong> - As noted in the previous blog, anyone who might be missing a payment from an event prior to April 14, 2019, must visit www.fortnite.com/esports to complete their profile. The majority of delays are caused by missing the Prize Acceptance and Release Form along with the Tax Form. These are completed by using a Docusign form that opens in a separate window as a single document for convenience.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<em>Country specific issues:</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Country not listed in Hyperwallet</strong> - We have a few countries not supported in Hyperwallet.\u00a0 Do not worry. We are tracking those cases and working on a solution to issue payment for validated players.\u00a0 Some players have chosen to receive their payment via US PayPal or convert into a different currency altogether to transfer their funds from Hyperwallet.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n\t<li><strong>French players who are minors</strong> - If you are a player in France and a minor (under 18 years of age), the processing of your payment will be delayed as we set up next steps with our internal teams to collect additional information required by your local government to finalize verification.\u00a0\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n",

         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>With the Fortnite World Cup Finals just around the corner, I wanted to help set the stage for the event by giving a quick look back into some of the history of competitive Fortnite. This blog is the first in a series titled Road to The Fortnite World Cup Finals, where we will be looking at some key players from past events that will be making an appearance on the main stage in New York City.</em><br />\n<br />\nThere have been so many highlight reel moments in Competitive Fortnite history, and many of the players who completed them will be competing in the Fortnite World Cup Finals. Let\u2019s dive into how some of the top competitors were able to make a name for themselves.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">European crowd favourites Dmitri \u201c<strong>Mitro</strong>\u201d Van de Vrie, and Kyle \u201c<strong>Mongraal</strong>\u201d Jackson rule over their rivals, dominating their competition week after week resulting in multiple high placements across the 10 weeks of qualifiers in Europe. Mitr0 got his start from the Solo Showdown and Blitz Showdown, being far and away the highest scoring player in the world. He would then proceed to turn that into multiple Skirmish victories and an ascent to the first EU Fortnite star. Meanwhile, his partner Mongraal became known due to his level of mechanical skill, high energy streams and end-game elimination montages. These two have been one of the favorites for the Duo competition since they announced they\u2019d play together, and Mongraal is also a threat to take the Solo crown.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">North America boasts arguably one of the best all around Battle Royale and Fortnite players of all time, Turner \u201c<strong>Tfue</strong>\u201d Tenney. The Fall Skirmish winner and long time BR vet will be looking to cement his name as one of Fortnite\u2019s premier talents. His practice focuses on putting himself into every situation possible, and having unique strategies to pull out when his back is against the wall. However, Tfue isn\u2019t the only of the old guard who will be representing on the Finals stage.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can not count out the endgame clutch specialist, Timothy \u201c<strong>Bizzle</strong>\u201d Miller. He was the original inspiration for most competitive player\u2019s movement and survival tactics during each match. Bizzle is always two steps ahead of anyone else in the lobby leading him to multiple wins and high leaderboard placing finishes in multiple tournaments. The Secret Skirmish solos winner hasn\u2019t slowed down his pace either, recently taking home the Trios Cash Cup title in NAEast, with Saf and Zayt.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking of <strong>Saf</strong> and <strong>Zayt</strong>, this duo is another one to keep an eye on. Saf won the Duos competition at Secret Skirmish, and followed it up with a second place finish in the Solos. Immediately after that, Saf and Zayt were able to take home the crown at the Katowice Royale with some incredibly well executed teamwork. Will they be able to keep the momentum rolling in NYC?</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contenders will be coming from all over the globe. <strong>X2Twins</strong> will be representing OCE in the Solos, and Jordan is no stranger to playing on the big stage, having been one of the few international players to bring home a win on a main Fortnite stage. <strong>TOP FaxFox </strong>will be looking to continue his winning ways. The winningest Solo player during the qualifiers, he was also at the Korean Open with a solid performance. Finally, the Brazilian Wunderkid <strong>Nicksss</strong> will look to eliminate the rest of the field with his aggressive style. The definitive strongest player coming from the region during the open qualifiers, will Nicksss be able to match up with the mechanical beasts of the other regions?</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of these Competitive Veterans will be looking to continue building on their legacy in New York City. Their competitive success and history, combined with the support of their fans, have already caused most of the Fortnite world to have their eyes on them. Will any of these players be able to break the ceiling of their stardom and crown themselves the first Fortnite World Cup champion? Or will one of these veterans be toppled by the horde of hungry players looking to name themselves among the best Fortnite players in the world.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tune in to the Fortnite World Cup Finals July 26-28, starting each day at\u00a012:30pm Eastern.

         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This is the final blog in the series, which means the World Cup is just around the corner! Now that you\u2019ve met some of the Veterans in our first piece, learned about some potential players you may not have heard of in the Dark Horses blog, and read about how they might interact early game in Crossing paths, it\u2019s time to set the stage for New York City. What is really different about playing on the stage? What changes have happened in game? How are the competitors going to be able to deal with the adversity of playing in a different environment? This piece will talk about one of the critical skills for Fortnite Champions, adapting under pressure, with the specific focus on the World Cup environment.</em><br />\n<br />\nThe Fortnite World Cup Finals will be some of the most intense Battle Royale matches that have ever been played. There have been some slight changes in the meta and some differences in terms of format from the Qualifiers that the players will need to consider when coming up with their gameplan. Let\u2019s dive into the main aspects that these competitors will be considering when playing in the finals.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Open Qualifier vs. Finals</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe Online Open Qualifiers meant that every player who wanted a chance to compete got one. This meant that lobbies would be unpredictable at times. Sometimes players would end up with eight people at their drop spot, while the next match there would be no one in sight. However, with consistently the same 100 players in the match, Fortnite World Cup Finals competitors are able to have slightly more predictable early game scenarios. This allows for players to get analytical, to go back through and study where their opponents drop, where they like to rotate and how to best take advantage of that information.<br />\n<br />\nPlayers who are able to execute on their battle plan are setting themselves up for success with a strong and consistent early game. But it can also cause problems when the early game doesn\u2019t go well. How will players adapt if they get eliminated right off the drop? What if it happens again? Who has prepared a back-up landing spot? How well did you study who is dropping in another spot? These are all major factors that will play into these players decision making.<br />\n<br />\nWe also saw how week after week, the competition level rose from each Semi-Final to Final. The top 3,000 in each region battling it out was an incredible display of skill, but now it is going to be the best of the best in every fight. There is no easy point in the field, and everyone has risen to the top out of millions. How will this impact decision making? Will certain aggressive players be a little less apt to go after someone else, knowing the skill level of their opponent? Or will we see the walls get thrown down, even under the lights of the main stage?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Online vs. In-Person</strong><br />\n<br />\nPerhaps the biggest difference for many of these players will be playing under the lights and in front of the crowd on the main stage. This is an environment that very few people have ever been in before, let alone had to perform at their absolute best in order to even compete. How much will experience play a factor? Will we see the veterans who have been to major events be able to slip into the zone right away? Will the newcomers fold under the pressure?<br />\n<br />\nOn top of all of those factors, how will the actual gameplay change? What is it like going against 98 or 99 of the best players in the world? How does that change every engagement? Will people be more nervous to push someone else, knowing you can\u2019t just queue up right away? Will the \u201c0 ping wall takers\u201d be as strong and aggressive? Will players be willing to risk challenging for high ground, knowing that you could be building straight into Stompy, or Tfue or Dubs? These are all questions that can only be answered when these titans take the stage and get onto the Island. Now that the stage is set, we are only moments away from the start of the Fortnite World Cup. Tune in to see how it all plays out!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tune in to the Fortnite World Cup Finals July 26-28, starting each day at\u00a012:30pm Eastern.

         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>With some of the key player\u2019s outlined in the Competitive Veterans blog and Dark Horses blog now having context, this blog will focus on some of the potential interactions that could be seen in the early game. Since Battle Royale middle and end games can be very unpredictable, the one data point that is relatively consistent is early game drops. Using data from the online open qualifiers, let\u2019s breakdown some of the fights and faceoffs that we could see on the stage in New York City.</em><br />\n<br />\nMultiple qualified players sharing drop spots and loot paths with one another means that sparks are bound to fly when feet hit the ground at the Fortnite World Cup Finals in New York City. Choosing where to drop and loot is what defines the rest of the game in terms of what items and utility can be acquired match to match. Each Point of Interest on the map offers something different to every player who drops out of the Battle Bus. These differences could range from vending machines, slipstreams, a central map location, more chests / floor loot, mat distribution, as well as many other factors. Each spot also has different elevations, layouts and buildings, favouring certain types of playstyles and patterns which competitive players are very mindful of and practice on a daily basis. With so many shared drop spots and POIs by competitors, who will win each matchup? Which region will claim a spot and leave a mark on the map for others to beware of? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key early game match-ups and confrontations we could see based off of their Fortnite World Cup Online Open Qualifier drop spots.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Solo Early Game Battles</strong><br />\n<br />\nHappy Hamlet. A drop spot with three vending machines, 36 chests, and loot spread out and segmented by houses. Tight angles indoors, but wide angles when peering over the town, is the reason Happy Hamlet is one of the most contested spots coming into the Fortnite World Cup Finals. Looking at everyone\u2019s drop spots from which they qualified during the open weeks, eight players (Clarity, Takamuramm, Evilmare, Emqu, Drakonz, Lyght, Luneze, and Mr Savage) all land for a Hamlet house as their early game bread and butter strategy. There is no safety net at Happy Hamlet either, as other competitors will have taken all the alternate loot paths early. This makes Happy Hamlet one of strongest looting spots on the map for an all-in strategy where players will have to make a judgement call on whether or not the risk is worth taking. With only six games to play, every match has to count to its full potential if you want a spot in the top ten overall. But will anyone switch their drop spots up and throw away tons of practice for a safer chance to make it out of early game? Or is the risk worth the reward at the end with a possibility to fight a potential eight to twelve people before the game really gets rolling?<br />\n<br />\nThe northwest corner of the map is another key section to keep an eye on. During the qualifiers Vivid, Nittle and Klusia all landed Junk Junction during Solos. The winner of this battle would then typically rotate east to loot, but they then run into one of the more contested areas: The Block. This POI is typically being battled out by Tfue and Kolorful from NAEast, and Nicks and Clipnode from the South American servers. With each player qualifying in separate weeks in a completely different Block experience, lessons learned and fighting styles developed here need to be re-learned with each Block update. Depending on which Block is selected for the Fortnite World Cup, competitors could be at a big advantage based off a Block that promotes engagements, is easily traversable, has lots of loot, or includes a large amount of mat variety.<br />\n\u00a0<br />\n<strong>Duos Early Game Battles</strong><br />\n<br />\nTwo of the most dominant teams in the competition shared a drop spot during the Online Open Qualifiers, and it will be interesting to see who will come out on top if they collide. Stompy and Tschiinken will be facing off directly across from the NAEast young titans of Dubs and Megga at Frosty Flights. Both teams are incredibly isolated at Frosty, so whoever gets the lower initial drop could end up at a significant advantage. A key note here is that Dubs and Megga can be a bit inconsistent, but tend to have the higher ceiling in terms of being able to produce high elimination matches. If they get forced out early by the European favorites, it could prove disruptive. However, Stompy and Tschiiinken tend to find a lot more of their success and eliminations in the mid to end game. This means that if Dubs and Megga can get the upper hand and put the other Duo on the back foot, it could derail what many see as the top contending Duo from coming in and getting their gameplay rolling. Whoever is able to leave Frosty victorious will be at a huge advantage, even if they just manage to force the other Duos out. There is not a lot of easily accessible loot in the surrounding areas, and plenty of teams will be lurking to catch the rotations.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Neo Tilted</strong><br />\nAnother early game POI to keep an eye on is the newly renovated Tilted Towers. Neo Tilted was home to four very talented Duos, who both split drop directly on top of each other. This has the potential to lead to some very hectic fights early on between some of the strongest eliminators in the field. Let\u2019s break down the matchups by Duos and who they would be facing off against in their respective one versus one.<br />\n<br />\nThe first set of duos is none other than Mongraal and Mitr0, one of the other favorites coming out of Europe, being matched up against the fast paced, aggressive Duo of Parpy and Volx from Oceania. These Duos tend to occupy the two central buildings, with Parpy and Mongraal landing on top of the Durr Burger tower, and Mitr0 and Volx facing off just to their west. With the aggressive nature of the OCE Duo, if they can get the faster drop, they could force Mongraal and Mitr0 off their gameplan and into a joint drop. This would be a huge disadvantage for the young EU pair, as they can get frustrated early if they don\u2019t get adequate loot and are forced to split resources early. However, Mongraal and Mitr0 are not scared to take early fights, especially if they are able to get any early damage onto their opponent. Their strongest trait is their ability to quickly and precisely pincer opponents at a disadvantage, forcing opponents to always be together for fear of being separated. They also need to be careful of getting out of rhythm since the OCE Duo will always be going at full speed, and if the EU Duo gets set behind, they are liable to get in their own heads. Expect to see early elims happening between these pairs for the first couple of games until they size each other up.<br />\n<br />\nThe other split drop to the north of Neo Tilted is another key battle, and these pairs are also not afraid to battle it out with their opponents. The French Duo of Oslo and NotBadSniper will be facing off directly against Clix and Sceptic, another pair of young lords from NAEast. Clix is known for being insanely aggressive and relentless against his opponents, but he will be faced off directly against NotBadSniper. Sniper has an almost-scary ability to know where opponents will be, and put himself at a positional advantage to exploit any over-aggression. If Clix makes a mistake, he will be punished, so this 1v1 in particular will be very interesting to watch. Just to the west of them will be the other half of their Duos, with Oslo matching up directly against Sceptic. Both are slightly less proactive than their counterpart, and generally wait for an opponent to leave themselves open before pressing an advantage. Expect these two to be looking to loot quickly and safely, and then get a line of fire to help their opponent. Regardless, Neo Tilted is looking to define a new age of champions, as whoever is able to claim Tilted has access to a ton of loot. Which of these Duos will be the new Kings of Tilted?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Tune In This Weekend</strong><br />\nAll of these early game match-ups have the chance to directly impact the course of every match, and some of these will be championship impacting. Who will get stonewalled at their drop spot? Who will be able to emerge victorious consistently? Who will be able to take their early game success and build it into a Fortnite World Cup title?</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tune in to the Fortnite World Cup Finals July 26-28, starting each day at\u00a012:30pm Eastern.

         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>While the Competitive Veterans blog focused on some of the more common names you hear in the competitive Fortnite world, this one will focus on some of the lesser well known players. The goal is to give you an idea of what makes these individuals successful, what the defining factor of their play style is and a little bit about how they got here. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the Dark Horses who have a shot to take home the Championship.</em><br />\n<br />\nWhile most of the Fortnite world is familiar with the Tfues, Mongraals and X2Twins of the world, there are so many additional incredibly talented players who will be taking the stage at the Finals in New York City. Here are some of the players who might not have as much of the fame, but are capable of taking down anyone else in the field and could end up a Fortnite World Cup Champion.<br />\n<br />\nReferred to as one of the strongest players in Europe yet still flying low under the radar of most fans and viewers, Theo \u201c<strong>Crue</strong>\u201d Ferrer, a double qualified player for the Valhalla Vikings, has the skill set, attitude, and experience to match any other player in the field. Qualifying for the EU Winter Royale Semi-Finals was just the first step in Crue\u2019s consistent run in Competitive Fortnite. Since then, he has qualified and placed within the top 40 consistently in almost every Open event within Fortnite, showing that his strength is consistency and adaptation to a meta that changes constantly. His partner for the duos portion of the cup, Moussa \u201c<strong>Chapix</strong>\u201d Faour will also be able to take a swing in the Duos segment of the Fortnite World Cup Finals. When both of these competitors get an early and successful rotation, they can set up and bait top players into positional traps near the end game, racking up more and more points as the circles start to move. Setting up funnel strategies like this on Finals day is going to be the win condition for Crue in Solos, and both Crue and Chapix in Duos. Their high game sense combined with months of synergy make them players with an accelerated understanding of game mechanics and movement patterns. Crue has an amazing opportunity to make an impact in both Solos and Duos, so keep an eye on where these guys are on the ladder.<br />\n<br />\nLate game and those final clutch moments in a really close Competitive Fortnite game are very important. To get to those big moving circle rotations that help to survive the rest of the match, you are going to need to have a strong early game. This is where NAE\u2019s Solo qualifier Jonothan \u201c<strong>Nittle</strong>\u201d Weinmen swoops in harder than anyone else, always getting an early elimination or two, removing any type of comfort a top player in his vicinity has during the early moments of the game. Qualifying in Week 3, Nittle\u2019s aggressive use of pushes early with precise aim and unorthodox angles always makes him start and end a fight with some of the biggest advantages you can possibly see. He\u2019s used his success in the Qualifier weeks to network with other players such as Crimz and Spades, who formed a trio with Nittle, grabbing the second place spot in the first Trios Cash Cup. Playing as an endgame position-focused Duo gives Nittle an extra boost in Solos, rounding out his repertoire and truly making him an ultimate beast of a player early game (and now late game as well). A fully rounded out player going into the Fortnite World Cup Finals with momentum from a high placing tournament finish is a formula built for victory. Anyone and anything in Nittle\u2019s path is up for grabs, whether that&#39;s eliminations, or the title of Solo Fortnite World Cup Champion.<br />\n<br />\nInternational expectations have been ramping up these past few weeks, and one interaction has been going underway in pro level scrimmages for a few weeks now. OCE\u2019s aggressive duo <strong>Parpy</strong> and <strong>Volx</strong> have been causing ripples across NAE games, moving over to NA to get vital practice and fully prepare for the Fortnite World Cup Duo Finals. This Duo\u2019s signature style of fighting has top pros on their heels, always getting tags down first and seamlessly switching between roles amongst themselves mid fight, as well as during late game on rotation. Like two puzzle pieces making up a picture, no other Duo utilizes and exploits their positioning quite as quick or as efficiently in a box fight like Parpy and Volx. Using heavy snipers and unorthodox loadouts as a tool to get in closer and to start fights, one big advantage these competitors have is being the leaders in every engagement and controlling the pace of whatever fight they have with their full-on pressure style from the get-go. Recently, the Duo placed 21st during the Trios Cash Cup in NAE, a region where the strategies, meta, and gamestyle is drastically different. They have already adjusted to how aggressively things work in two different regions, and are about to start putting the pressure on global domination as they finish up practice for the main event.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nOver in the South American region, Argentinian Fortnite prodigy Tiago \u201c<strong>k1ng</strong>\u201d Lapp has been making waves and double qualified through controlled aggressive play. A player on 9z Team, he pushed the limits in a region where only the pinnacle of placements and gameplay would allow you to qualify for the Fortnite World Cup. K1ng\u2019s use of patience and timing, especially in box fights and endgame, messes up the traditional rhythm most players are used to following allowing him to take shots and drop down on players when they are at their most vulnerable. Pioneering the strategy in South American servers of waterfalling down and \u201call-inning\u201d players with a vertical advantage from odd angles, k1ng shreds the player count. His specialty is in earning high back-to-back elimination games where sometimes the first elimination starts 20 minutes into the match during the sixth moving circle, yet lets him end with over 15 eliminations before he queues up for another. Like a snake charmer he can expect and read opponents with dangerous fangs, moving them exactly where he wants to before he strikes, every move methodical yet tactically aggressive. Qualifying with only eight \u00a0games played and a total of 144 points, k1ng will use the advantage he has with double qualifying and being able to absorb as much information as possible during Solos to apply to Duos, potentially bringing out another efficient and repeat performance with record breaking averages.<br />\n<br />\nWill any of these players be able to show the world that they are among the best of the best? Will a new player rise to the fore of the Fortnite scene? Or will the old guard of veterans be able to hold off the horde of hungry newcomers? The ultimate Victory Royale is there for the taking, and any of these players have the ability to take home the title of Fortnite World Cup Champion.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tune in to the Fortnite World Cup Finals July 26-28, starting each day at\u00a012:30pm Eastern.

As a result, we\u2019ve added more prize pool allocation to these regions moving forward in future tournaments to be more in line with the most active competitive populations in each region!\n<h2><br />\nPayments Update</h2>\nOver the past several weeks we\u2019ve activated our new payment system for some of our Online Open players. The new system is a two step process. The first step begins with an email directly from Epic Games to verify player information. The second step beings with an email from our payment partner Hyperwallet. We have seen a lot of players asking about the legitimacy of the Hyperwallet email. These emails are legitimate but if you are uncomfortable clicking the link in the email, you can visit <a href=\"https://epicgames.hyperwallet.com\">https://epicgames.hyperwallet.com</a> to activate your account with your Epic Account ID or the email address associated with your Epic Games Account. After we work through issues found with this initial batch of winners, we\u2019ll begin opening up the system to all winners.<br />\n\u00a0",

We recognize that we failed at making the current process as easy to navigate and understand as it should be. We\u2019re going to fix this and would like to update you on future improvements we\u2019re making to the overall process. For those players who are still experiencing issues, we\u2019re working to be more proactive in collecting any incomplete or incorrect information that we need to process payments.</p>\n\n<h2>Payment Process Improvements (COMING SOON)</h2>\nOur primary areas of focus for improvements to the Competitive Payment process include: (i) providing players with status updates, via email, on a regular basis; (ii) creating a more intuitive landing page and payment flow that allows players to more easily track the status of their payments; and (iii) enabling players to more easily make changes to their information. Find more details on the upcoming changes below:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We will now be sending regular email updates on payment status to players.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Please note that all communication and payment information will be processed via the email associated with your winning EpicID.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The tax information verification process and \u201cPrize Acceptance and Release Form\u201d segments will now be combined into the same location.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>For minor players, their parent/guardian will also need to provide their email and phone number to accept the payment on behalf of the minor. \u00a0\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Note:</strong> The minor is still considered the prize recipient and will be issued a 1099-Misc or 1042-S, as applicable, by Epic.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Tax verification can take up to two weeks.</li>\n\t\t<li>Once the tax information verification process has been completed, players will only need to agree to the consent form for future events.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Future improvements will enable players to more easily update their information without the need for assistance from Player Support.

         "content": "Heya folks,<br />\n<br />\nFor this week\u2019s competitive update we\u2019re jumping into recent competitive rulings and an update on payment status. Last week we wrapped up our competitive AMA and if you missed any of the questions or answers you can see all the info we dropped in this blog. Thank you to everyone who participated!<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Week 10 World Cup Qualifier</h2>\nWe announced earlier this week that we\u2019re moving the dates for the Week 10 Fortnite World Cup Online Open. The Semi-Finals will now take place on Thursday, June 20th, while the Finals will take place on Friday, June 21st. We will also be doubling the prize pool for Week 9 and Week 10, for a new total of $2,000,000 for each tournament. The schedule and timing for Week 9 will remain the same.<br />\n<br />\nFor Week 10, the start time for each region will begin one hour later than the previous weeks\u2019 scheduled tournaments. When in doubt, consult the in-game tournament times.<br />\n<br />\nRemember, this is your last chance to qualify for the Finals in New York City. Best of luck!<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Payments</h2>\nBack in early May, we posted our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/fortnite-competitive-payments\">Competitive Payments</a> blog to give you better visibility into our payment process for Fortnite competitive play. Since then, we\u2019ve been regularly updating the blog with the latest payment status for each of our previous tournaments. As we\u2019ve continued to process payments each week for confirmed winners, we\u2019ve also been working on a scalable payments solution to handle cash prize payments for the Fortnite World Cup Online Open winners, Creative Trials winners and beyond. While we\u2019ve made significant progress towards this new payment solution, we still have a few more administrative pieces to finalize before we can launch it publicly. In the meantime, we will continue to process our payment backlog and issue payments as quickly and efficiently as possible using our more manual solution. For the latest on payment progress updates, be sure to <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/fortnite-competitive-payments\">continue to check our competitive payments blog</a>.\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Teaming Rulings</h2>\nWe assess penalties for teaming scenarios based on our penalty matrix. Initial infractions and first time offenses include disqualification and forfeiture of prizes from a given event and a 14-day competitive ban. Repeated infractions or increased severity, such as evident teaming across multiple matches or coordinating against an opponent, results in a more severe penalty.<br />\n<br />\nFor more information on our previous teaming rulings, check out our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/weekend-issues-update-and-competitive-ruling-5-2-19\">Week 3 competitive update blog</a>.\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n",

         "title": "Competitive AMA Transcript",
         "content": "Hey folks! We&#39;ve rounded up all the questions and answers from our recent competitive AMA. Let&#39;s jump in:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/JorisR94: Are you guys considering a separate loot pool for Arena/competitive?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Not at the present time.<br />\n<br />\nHaving the same core battle royale game played by players of all skill levels is healthy for the overall state of the game and keeps competition open, approachable, and for both players and viewers.<br />\n<br />\nWe aim at one game, however we occasionally make exceptions (such as Siphon), but our threshold for branching core gameplay is very high. It&#39;s up to us to find new directions for balance that reward players at every skill level, while not creating negative experiences for different groups. Even as Epic focuses on competitions where all are welcome to play in familiar ways, we\u2019ll also be continuing to add tools that will allow players to customize their experience to fit their personal preferences and the way they would most like to play.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/pauperdown: How do you see the future of Arena? Do you have any plans on adding new divisions and incentives like leaderboards and small prizes, so Arena feels more competitive?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We are currently working on a refresh of Arena, with an emphasis around providing more high quality, exciting matches and tournaments with meaningful stakes. &#39;Hype&#39; will become more like a currency which you use to enter tournaments and participate in higher difficulty Arena matches, with top overall performers for the season represented on a leaderboard. Seasonal rewards are on the roadmap as well for future iterations of Arena.<br />\n<br />\nWe also want to get back to running nightly (non-prized) tournaments on a regular basis, across a wider variety of team sizes & game modes. Having Hype as rewards for placements in these tournaments will help provide some meaning and motivation behind each competition, even when cash isn&#39;t on the line.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: @CowboyFN_: How does Storm Surge work now? What circle does it activate? How many people have to be alive at what circle for it to activate? Sometimes you get a warning and sometimes it&#39;s active. Why is this?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: First a little history - Storm Surge was initially added to help in competitive matches where an unusual number of players were still around and server performance would degrade. Ultimately having less players in a match directly impacts this, and our goal is to ride the line between minimal gameplay impact while maintaining a playable server framerate. Siphon was also added to help balance the risk/reward of eliminating another player - primarily to help reduce turtling & encourage a healthier \u2018elimination curve\u2019.<br />\n<br />\nTo answer your specific questions, storm surge activates if the number of players in a match is higher than the values designated below at each storm phase. Surge will deal 25 damage to each player under the damage threshold, and this damage occurs every 5 seconds. We give a brief 5 second window of opportunity for players to react to this incoming damage. Storm Surge will immediately end as soon as the threshold is reached.<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 0 - 100 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 1 - 100 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 2 - 70 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 3 - 70 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 4 - 50 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 5 - 50 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 6 - 30 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 7 - 30 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 8 - 30 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nStorm Phase 9 - 30 Players Allowed<br />\n<br />\nAs an example, if there were 72 players remaining in Storm Phase 3 (where 70 players is the cap), Surge would continually deal damage to all players under the damage threshold until there were only 70 players left. Once only 70 players remain, it would end immediately until Storm Phase 4.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/jamalzlitni10: A topic that has emerged in the community is building pre-edits. Many of us believe that pre editing should be an option to toggle on or off. Do you guys have any intent on making a change with pre-edits in the future?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Yes, this is a topic we\u2019re actively considering, and will update you on when future plans are firm.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/kr0n_cs: From an observing point of view, how many people do you generally have observing and how does it work? Do they sit in front of 100 screens and monitor where the action will be, or is it just looking at the map and going to players who are nearby? Do you use any sort of way to automatically detect where the action will be, so that when players are about to fight, you will know where that will be?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Great question! A lot depends on the show or event. We&#39;ve had anywhere from 2 to 30 live observers in a match. We also now have two options for covering matches; live spectating and streaming server replays. There can be some differences in how we cover a match depending on which option we&#39;re using.<br />\n<br />\nFor online events, such as our weekly World Cup qualifier show, we use streaming server replays. We&#39;ll typically have a crew of 13 observers which is composed of 2 teams of 5 as well as a game producer, game director, and observer director. In this case we have one team covering the match that is currently live, and the other team is watching and preparing for the next match on deck. Then we just swap between teams. Since we&#39;re using server replays and not presenting the matches \"live\" the teams will generally know, or have a pretty good idea of what happens in the match. Each team has a temporal scout that quickly finds relevant moments in the match for the team to cover. During the show the observer teams take direction from the game director and observer director to frame up shots and bring up the appropriate gameplay feeds. As the match plays out, the game director selects which views to cut to. The game producer&#39;s job is to guide the flow of the covers and is following both the map and any information about the match that the scouts were able to extract.<br />\n<br />\nCovering matches live is a bit trickier. For our live events we use live spectating and have a slightly larger team of 17 observers. We&#39;ll typically have 4 teams of 3, 2 flex observers, a game producer, game director, and observer director. Since we are broadcasting a live match and anything can happen we use more teams to make sure we (almost) always have something both relevant and interesting we can jump to. As you can imagine making sure you are always covering the best action (Live!) can be difficult when players are spread all across the island! We also capture each team with a video replay system in case they capture something while another team was live on air. We&#39;ve added mid-match replays to cover some of this stuff and fill lulls in the match. During a live match the game producer is watching the map, player stats, and listening to the observer teams, and taking into account previous matches in order to steer the coverage and find relevant action to jump to.<br />\n<br />\nHere is a shot from the observer pit at Secret Skirmish: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/i7nBuoQ\">https://imgur.com/i7nBuoQ</a><br />\nFor fun here is what 100 player feeds looks like: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/vVURxy8\">https://imgur.com/vVURxy8</a><br />\n<br />\nIn terms of automating coverage we are actively developing a tool that can watch a live match (or replay) and determine the best moments based on a certain set of criteria. Some of these things include; Players closing distance on each other, elim streaks, long distance elims, no scopes, etc. We could use this tool to suggest when/where to cut to in a live show or allow people to automatically generate highlight reels from their own matches. A lot of what makes good coverage can be subjective so finding a good balance of what the criteria is and how a tool selects a moment in the match is what we&#39;re looking into right now. We can&#39;t wait to share this tool with everyone as soon as it is ready.<br />\n<br />\nSomething interesting to note, we use the same tools to make our weekly show that are available for everyone in the live version of the game currently.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/KurtMage: Has a competitive 2v2 mode (or even 1v1 or larger) ever been considered? The building mechanic in this game is incredible and feels like it should not be confined exclusively to the battle royale genre (for competitive). I&#39;m not asking for something specific, it could be made with a CS-like buy system, COD-like load out system, Halo-like weapons on map system, TF-like class system, or whatever. I (and many) just love the mechanic and would love to see it on a non battle royale setting.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We are definitely considering all kinds of possibilities when it comes to alternate competitive modes outside of Battle Royale. We have plans to continue to expand Creative Mode so players can create their own favorite version(s) of Fortnite. We\u2019ll be closely monitoring these community-created competitive modes as the tools for Creative Mode expand, and will officially support some of the more popular ones that pop up over time.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Kessarean: Will FOV see a reconsideration?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We have no plans to implement an FOV slider. One of our major goals for competitive Fortnite is to support players in their journey to be able to become stars and build their own audiences around awesome performances and personas. Part of that goal means listening to the desires of their viewers, and stepping in when necessary. In this case, players were indicating they felt required to play with stretched resolution (or increased FOV) in order to remain competitive, and fans said that it was a negative experience to watch.<br />\n<br />\nWe also don\u2019t have any plans to adjust the current default FOV. As stated in our previous communication on the topic: <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-development-update\">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-development-update</a>, it\u2019s ultimately a tradeoff of a series of goals and we\u2019re happy with where it\u2019s at currently.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/beaushinkle: With the number of items / changes geared toward punishing boxes (stinks, explosive damage through walls, etc) it seems like the team isn&#39;t happy with how strong the box is in competitive play. Do you guys have plans to enable aggressive players who want to force fights with defensive players?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We\u2019re always looking at the balance of core gameplay. That includes items, weapons, building, loot availability, and more. Defensive building is strong, and there should always be some counters, but not excessively so. In general having a few items that force alternative strategies or requiring players to react is healthy for keeping the moment to moment fresh.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/DatGuyRich: We&#39;ve seen over the last few world cup weeks that numerous streamers are pulling the same amount of numbers as the official Fortnite stream mainly because people prefer this method of spectating. So during the world cup will there be an option to spectate from one player&#39;s POV?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We\u2019re totally fine with streamers pulling in bigger numbers than our channel, and this possibility was something we had actually looked forward to in creating our approach. In general it&#39;s a goal of ours to help drive traffic to our players&#39; streams. We completely understand that people may want to only watch their favorite streamer vs our show. Our coverage is generally meant to serve viewers who may not have a favorite streamer or who are looking for more information about a tournament as a whole.<br />\n<br />\nAs an example of how we want to continue the spirit of supporting players and streamers first, for World Cup we will also be streaming the finalists\u2019 replays LIVE, so if you wanted to you could load up the replay while the match is happening and watch from your favorite player&#39;s perspective.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Pmoney98: The shotgun pullout delay was initially added to prevent the \u2018double shotgun\u2019 meta. In the current state of the game, double shotgun is both obsolete and irrelevant. The pullout delay feels obtrusive and clunky. Are there any plans to change this?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We\u2019re looking into possible tuning iterations here - the main thing we want to keep in mind is that the Pump Shotgun is still available in Creative (and always has the potential to be unvaulted), so we want to make sure that any adjustments take its unique characteristics into consideration.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/hriship1999: Any plans on removing the boom bow?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: There are balance adjustments coming in the 9.20 update. We&#39;ll be continuing to evaluate after these changes as well.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: Would you guys ever consider adaptive chests that drop different loot depending on what items the player has already looted/seen from previous chests in that game? Or perhaps adaptive floor loot so that the floor loots in a single house won&#39;t be all of the same weapon/item type?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We considered this early on, but decided against it. The main downside being - if your opponent gets a powerful weapon because he hasn&#39;t had one recently, that&#39;s an unfair experience to you. But, we regularly revisit these kinds of questions to make sure our thinking is still up to date.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/vSilvr: Why are there 5 snipers in the game?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We&#39;re actively looking at this, the main reason being that each one provides a somewhat different role. But we agree it&#39;s probably a little higher than we&#39;d like.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /uWerkit5: It seems the shotgun timer issue could easily be solved by having the timer enabled if the player is holding multiple shotguns, and disabled otherwise. What am I missing here? I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s more complicated than that.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: This is one of the options on the table - it&#39;s being actively discussed.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Joeys_1k: Could you please touch somewhere on ballers? The ballers are a great idea and fun thing to use, perfect for core playlists. But in arena/competitive, it completely takes away from the core values of competitive (1. movement 2. materials 3. gun skill)\u00a0</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We&#39;ve discussed potentially disabling vehicles after storm phase 5, similar to how Slipstreams are disabled. Our main concern is making sure it&#39;s clear what&#39;s going on, so we&#39;re still iterating here.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/NikosKan2004: Any plans to unvault the pump?\u00a0</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Vaulted weapons/items always have the possibility to come back.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/EightBit5: What\u2019s the percentage on the amount of deaths by a Drum Gun or SMG?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We&#39;re always evaluating weapon variety. I actually just checked - Drum Guns are currently accountable for 5.26% of eliminations.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/scoobyaimbots: So far all we\u2019ve had is Solos and Duo tournaments probably due to the servers. Are there plans for competitive Trios or Squads in the future?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We will definitely be getting back to running regular Trios and Squads tournaments soon.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: With prize pools?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Sure. :)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/itsAtxm: Is there any plan on making a separate arena or competitive mode for only console players? Some of the more casual players would like the experience of playing at a competitive level against people with the same hardware. Also, are there plans on bringing squads and/or trios to an arena mode, and if so is there an estimated time on when we\u2019d be seeing this?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We will be running a few console/mobile specific tournaments in the future, but the majority of tournaments and Arena will continue to be mixed.<br />\n<br />\nTrios/Squads coming soon but don\u2019t have a date - will be after the Online Opens wrap up though.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/omarFN: Have you guys considered changing the format of the 1 million weekly tournament after the world cup, like hosting customs for top 100 of each region?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We are locked in to format for the Online Opens, but we\u2019ve definitely talked about possibly extending another round of the tournament with the Top 100 (or 500ish) players. Need to solve some of the matchmaking challenges around automating that.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/TyrellBagnum: Why not use the winter royale format each week? While obviously keeping the scoring the same as it is now.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Winter Royale finals were a massive, manual undertaking that involved getting 200+ players into a Discord server within a week and then coordinating those players getting into custom matches together. It was a real scramble!<br />\n<br />\nWe thought it went pretty well, but need a more automated solution so that we can run more tournaments regularly in all of our server regions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: Is there any future for sea server player on competitive fortnite?\u00a0</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We are always assessing potential for additional Arena/Tournament server locations. The skill-based nature of matchmaking means we need more players from a region to create quality matches, and for tournaments players need to hit a single server location for competition integrity reasons. Additionally, only certain locations have server availability for the more powerful servers high end tournament play requires.<br />\n<br />\nWe are exploring the idea of running occasional tournaments on alternate server fleets in smaller sub-regions, but don\u2019t have a specific date.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Flippingdeath: Is there going to be any competitive Ltms Like competitive solid gold.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We are actively working on updates to be able to run LTM tournaments - Solid Gold Squads will actually be our first LTM tournament :)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Noobface_: Is it possible to have someone\u2019s player stay inside of a game (motionless) if they disconnect? That way you can join back but someone could\u2019ve still killed you in that time. Many other games do this and it\u2019s a really neat feature.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We actually implemented this feature in a recent update but disabled due to an associated bug. There&#39;s a fix for the issue in the v9.20 update so you&#39;ll see this return!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/bradleycarlyle: Is there work being put into the audio side of the game?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Yes! We actually have regular audio updates hitting the FortniteBR sub weekly that generally get crossposted here - <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bqyoen/audio_content_features_and_fixes_for_91_release/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bqyoen/audio_content_features_and_fixes_for_91_release/</a> Expect the comms to keep coming :)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/ImProspect: Will you be communicating your reasoning behind changes/nerfs/additions to the game in the patch notes more often? Such as in the patch notes for v9.10 where epic&#39;s thoughts were communicated at the bottom of each change in italics?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Yes, we plan to continue doing that and in places you feel we could be more clear with our goals behind changes - speak up!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/tiller921: Without trying to sound disrespectful, why is the spectating in this game so... rough, compared to other games?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We&#39;re always looking to improve and iterate on the spectating and replays. Of course we want the best viewing experience for everyone. What are some specific things you would like to see?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Ziggomatic_: Will there be a stream dedicated to display the minimap and players remaining in the future WC event like at the IEM Katowice tournament? If yes, can you add pattern like grid, tiles or cross on arrows and add it on the remaining players list to help viewers differentiate between teams, and sort the remaining list by points earned by each teams ?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We&#39;re looking into having a few different streams with one of them being a persistent map and some more situational information.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/FruityFeathers: In LAN events like the Secret Skirmish, how do you add facecams onto the player perspectives? Is it automatic or do you have do each one individually?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Good question! We actually have an automatic tool for switching facecams. It&#39;s based on which camera a spectator is watching and then it automatically selects the proper face cam is routed. As you might imagine capturing, transporting, and switching between 100 camera feeds can be tough. We need it to be instant so we can cut to any view quickly so having an automated system was critical.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: What improvements are you making to the replay system?<br />\nAre you aware that skipping is currently extremely broken?<br />\nWhat new features are you adding to the replay system?<br />\nAre we gonna see a different spectating system for the World Cup? Everyone can see that the current one is struggling.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We are always looking for ways to improve the replay system. Some of the upcoming improvements include improved HUD and situational information.<br />\n<br />\nWe are generally aware of the issues with the replay system. As with most aspects of Fortnite it is constantly evolving.<br />\n<br />\nWe are working on adding blendable cameras as well as an auto-highlight tool.<br />\n<br />\nWe will not have a new spectating system but it will be improved. For our coverage of World Cup we&#39;ll be using Live Spectator. Live-ish server replays will also be available during the World Cup (and ProAm!) matches.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/NeverBenCurious: What makes you feel more excitement early game or endgame? Playing or watching.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Will the WC offer individual or team perspectives and comms? Communication is key and sometimes it&#39;s hard to follow 100 different perspectives each game.</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Definitely endgame! And watching since I don&#39;t usually last past the moving circles!<br />\n<br />\n\u200bWe will have both individual comms and team comms. We&#39;ll be able to take their mics to air which will be fun especially for Duos, Creative, and the ProAm.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Efelo75: Would you agree that the Creative mode has insane potential for Competitive Fortnite ? Ever considered using it for this purpose ? Or maybe are you already considering this?<br />\nMaybe the Creative World Cup is a start, but seriously seeing as how customizable Creative mode is and how it can evolve don&#39;t you think it has exceptional potential for esport, as you could basically change rules so much more easily than regular matches ?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Yes to all :)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: How are the improvements to the player payout process going? Also, can we get a confirmation that there are weekly tournaments after the World Cup ends?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: We&#39;re diligently working to finish paying players from events prior to the Fortnite World Cup Warmup. For all tournaments from Fortnite World Cup Warmup and beyond, we are still verifying and confirming winners. You can find our most-up-to date tracking of this in our payments blog here: <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-payments\">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-payments</a>. We&#39;ll also have a payments update next week.<br />\n<br />\nYes, there will be more cash prize tournaments after Fortnite World Cup ends. Stay tuned!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/AshxRobin: Can you please explain what future plans you have for custom matchmaking?\u00a0</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Next release, we have plans to improve private matchmaking functionality. These improvements include:<br />\n<br />\n1) Only allowing the server host to start the match.<br />\n<br />\n2) Allowing the server host to see how many players are in queue for that matchmaking key, rather than all players who are in queue for a private match in the host&#39;s region.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q: /u/Karam2468: Will there ever be an implementation of a widget to show the current storm phase along with indicators as to when slipstreams and dropships will be disabled?</strong><br />\n<br />\nA: Adding current storm phase to the HUD is great feedback and I will make sure to relay this to the team.<br />\n<br />\nAs for the slipstreams and drop ships being disabled after phase 5 we agree there should be more feedback and we plan to make sure there&#39;s corresponding feedback for them being disabled. This is currently planned for 9.20<br />\n<br />\n\u00a0",

         "content": "Hey Fortnite event organizers,<br />\n<br />\nEarlier this year, we released our Support-A-Creator Event License Agreement with guidelines to enable third-parties to host online events without needing any additional clearance from Epic. Outside of our main constraints around prize money and sponsorships, our goal is to allow a wide group of event organizers to host their own Fortnite tournaments.<br />\n<br />\nToday we\u2019ve updated the Event License Agreement to apply to the greater Fortnite community, not just Support-A-Creator members, along with a few important additions. The new Event License Agreement permits anyone in the community to host online and/or limited physical Fortnite tournaments so long as they meet the terms of the agreement . This means you can host your own local tournament at a physical location, again noting there are some restrictions in place around prize pools, sponsorships, and branding guidelines.<br />\n<br />\nTo help out, we\u2019ve put together <a href=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite+Esports%2Fevents%2Fguidelines%2FThirdPartyEvents-%281%29-cccf3bc869263fd155dbf697c94df3a8409e2278.pdf\">branding guidelines</a> that outline how to create marketing or promotional materials for your events, whether online or at a physical location.<br />\n<br />\nAs this is our first pass at a community-wide Event Licensing Agreement, there will be tweaks we need to make to the agreement as we start to better understand all of the various use-cases for tournaments folks are hoping to organize. We\u2019ll update everyone as any changes are made, and you\u2019ll always find the most recent documentation on our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events\">events page.</a><br />\n<br />\nThanks for being such an important part of the Fortnite community!\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0</div>\n",

         "title": "Arena Matchmaking Improvements & Upcoming AMA",
         "content": "<h2>Arena Matchmaking Improvements</h2>\nShortly after v9.10, we rolled out a new iteration of our Arena matchmaking logic and have since been reviewing and tweaking the mode.<br />\n<br />\nPreviously, we used a model where you would search for opponents with a similar amount of Hype, and that Hype range would expand over time to search more widely for suitable players. \u00a0After 15 minutes of waiting, we would give up and create the best match possible based on the players available at that specific moment. To prevent issues where players with extremely high amounts of Hype would never find each other successfully, anyone over 350 Hype was considered equal for matchmaking purposes.<br />\n<br />\nThe main issue of this old model was that all players searching for a game needed to expand their Hype range to reach each other mutually. This means that players in high population divisions would create matches easily, leaving players in low population divisions still searching for additional players.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe new matchmaking system uses a set of Hype ranges which define a series of buckets. \u00a0If a bucket doesn\u2019t have enough players participating in it, it will merge with a neighbor bucket after a certain amount of time. \u00a0We are expecting this to create better matches for players in all divisions, and greatly reduce occurrences where Champion League players are matched with Open League opponents after an extended wait. \u00a0Additionally, it should scale into smaller regions during time windows when there are fewer players in the highest and lowest divisions.<br />\n<br />\nWe are closely monitoring both queue times and match quality on the new system. We\u2019re still actively making adjustments, so you may experience some interruptions as we tweak the new system. Be sure to hop in and give it a try.\n<h2><br />\nHow to Report Bugs</h2>\nThrough the community\u2019s help, we\u2019ve managed to tackle some notable issues over the last few weeks at a faster cadence. We will continue to do this, and your help accelerates our process. The quality of each bug report goes a long way in helping us investigate and troubleshoot problems, particularly with complex competitive issues. Including as much of the following information in each bug report expedites our internal bug-squashing process:<br />\n<br />\n1) Clear and detailed description of the bug, and when it occurs.\n<ul>\n\t<li>The more detailed the description, the faster and more accurately we can investigate.</li>\n\t<li>Including the date that the bug was experienced on helps us narrow down specific updates and hot-fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n2)\u00a0Platform the bug occurs on.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sometimes, specific bugs only affect certain platforms.\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Listing this information also helps us explore if an issue is occurring on only one platform, or across our entire ecosystem.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n3) Video evidence of the bug.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A video is worth 1,000 words.</li>\n\t<li>Linking to specific clips allow us to attempt direct reproduction internally.</li>\n\t<li>If you see something, say something! Even if you aren&#39;t playing yourself, you can make a difference by clipping bugs and issues while watching your favorite players compete.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n4) Player logs and the in-game report button.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Player logs provide us direct insight into many different variables that occur in a match. They are incredibly useful to our team when we triage bugs.</li>\n\t<li>You can directly submit a bug report in-game by navigating to the menu\u00a0and selecting the \u201cFeedback\u201d button, which will automatically send these logs to us.

         "title": "Performance and Competitive Communication Update",
         "content": "Hey folks!\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThis week we\u2019re openly discussing critical bugs found over the weekend, new features, and our upcoming competitive-focused AMA.\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Weekend Issues</h2>\nLast week, we discovered a critical issue where players could become stuck in a vehicle and unable to exit. We made the choice to remove the root of the issue by disabling all vehicles, rather than electing to play through the Finals even with the bug. We felt that it was more fair to remove all vehicles to ensure players weren\u2019t penalized for something outside of their control during the Finals.<br />\n<br />\nDue to a critical issue with players getting stuck inside vehicles, we will be disabling all vehicles in Arena and Fortnite World Cup Online Opens through this weekend. We plan on re-enabling vehicles in the Tournament and Arena playlists next week after our fix is implemented in the v9.10 update. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe also discovered several audio issues where, in certain situations, gun-fire was ducking building sounds, and player landing sound could be silenced if players landed at a certain velocity. Thanks to a bug report and replay files provided by CouRage, these audio bugs were triaged and will also be fixed in the upcoming 9.10 release alongside other audio improvements.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nFor insight into our current tracking of top community issues, head on over to our <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues\">public Trello board here</a>.\n\n<h2><br />\nDisconnecting Duos Update</h2>\nIn <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/drum-gun-ltms-as-tournaments-and-disconnecting-duos\">last week\u2019s communication blog</a>, we spoke to the disconnecting duo issue experienced by a small number of duo teams in the Fortnite World Cup Online Open. For this weekend, we\u2019ve changed the game logic of how disconnecting duos work.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nIn Week 6, players who have their duo disconnect while loading into the pre-match island will be able to leave the match without penalty prior to the Battle Bus launching. Once the Bus launches, the team will have the match count to decide if the solo remaining player decides to stay.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nFor future duo tournament weekends, we are working to add in game messaging to make this decision crystal clear. We hope to have this implemented in a future update by the next duos weekend.\n<h2><br />\nUpcoming Balance Adjustments</h2>\nIt\u2019s important that we do better moving forward when explaining intent for various changes within Battle Royale. Starting with the v9.01 patch notes, we are working to give extra context when we make significant game changes.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThis week, we made changes to the Drum Gun, Baller, Compact SMG, and Slipstreams. Hop into the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/patch-notes/v9-01\">patch notes</a> for some insight into these adjustments.\n\n<h2><br />\nHold to Swap</h2>\nWe initially added this feature to help improve early game looting, making it easier to get weapons & items in the slots that you wanted. We\u2019ve fixed some bugs and iterated on this feature since its release, but recognize that some players may not want it enabled at all.<br />\n<br />\nWith an upcoming release, we\u2019ll be making \u201cHold to Swap\u201d a settings option, giving you the choice.\n<h2><br />\nPerformance</h2>\nThis past Season 9 launch revealed several performance regressions on Console, Switch and Mobile. Since then, we\u2019ve been conducting internal investigations in order to determine root causes and iterative changes we can make in each next release.<br />\n<br />\nIn the v9.01 release on Wednesday we included a few initial fixes such as improving level streaming for all platforms. Level streaming accelerates in-game level loading and results in blurry geometry being displayed less.<br />\n<br />\nThrough our work in progress for our next update (v9.10) and beyond, we are continuing performance efforts to improve level streaming on all platforms.\u00a0\n<h2><br />\nAMA</h2>\nIn addition to our weekly communications, we will be holding an AMA in the next few weeks on the Fortnite Competitive subreddit. This AMA will be specifically focused around questions regarding competitive Fortnite. We will share the time and date as we finalize the details.",

         "title": "Drum Gun, LTMs as Tournaments, and Disconnecting Duos",
         "content": "Hey all,<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re chatting this week about the recently unvaulted Drum Gun, the concept of LTMs in the tournament playlist, and want to weigh in on the discussion around, \u201cWhat happens when my Duo partner disconnects?\u201d Let\u2019s jump in.<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Drum Gun</h2>\nThis past weekend during the Unvaulting event, the community at large chose to bring back the Drum Gun from the Vault. The gun was immediately added to loot tables in all modes within Fortnite (including Arena) except the ongoing Tournament playlist for the weekend.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nYou can expect to see the Drum Gun in this weekend\u2019s Tournament playlist. In the v9.00 update today we\u2019ve adjusted the spawn rate of the Drum Gun to be more in line with other similar items. We will be closely monitoring feedback over the Season launch to determine any next steps.<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>LTMs as Tournaments</h2>\nAfter our Fortnite World Cup Online Opens conclude, we\u2019re exploring adding additional fun, new ways to compete. In the weeks leading up to the Fortnite World Cup Finals, we\u2019ll be experimenting with adding additional non-Battle Royale events, such as Creative modes and LTMs, to our weekly tournament rotation. This will open up a more dynamic competitive scene that allows for more paths to win. We encourage you to hop in, try out some new modes, and have a good time while we gather learnings each week. We\u2019ll have more information to share as we get closer to the conclusion of the Online Opens.<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Disconnecting Duos</h2>\nWe\u2019ve seen reports since Week 2 regarding a situation where a Duo partner does not load in a tournament match, but the remaining player is still able to participate and appears to be able to acquire points. Officially, however, the Duo will not receive the points earned in that match due to the disconnection.<br />\n<br />\nIn our Arena and Tournament Modes, a match is currently not counted towards the 10 placement matches if a Duo partner disconnects while loading into the pre-match island prior to the Battle Bus being boarded. This was by design, as we see playing alone against Duos as a heavy disadvantage, and many players would not want to have one of their 10 possible placement matches scored under those unusual and unfair conditions. Additionally we reflect this in our official rules in the following section:<br />\n<br />\n<em>4.2.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0During Stage One all players on a team must be present and partied up together in order to participate in this stage of the Event. Players on a team may not play Solo during Stage One.\u00a0</em><br />\n<br />\nHowever, we do want to solve for the edge cases where this design penalizes players who are able to excel despite being faced with a disconnection. In the v9.10 update, we are planning to add specific new in-game messaging and options to address the rare cases where a teammate disconnects while loading in the pre-match island. This messaging will provide you with the option to confirm leaving the match, or the option to decline and play through the match as the solo remaining player. Note: If you do not make a selection, we will default to removing you from the match before the Battle Bus launches. We will default this way because in nearly all cases, it\u2019s more advantageous to start a new match with your partner, rather than potentially wasting \u00a0one of your 10 maximum games by being forced to play as a solo against duos.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve seen suggestions that previously discarded solo matches in Duos should be included in Fortnite World Cup scoring, and that standings should be changed accordingly. Based on the current implementation of the rules, however, we will not be retroactively changing the results of the tournament.This would have cascading effects on integrity, with some teams having also exceeded the 10 match maximum played.\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Season 9 Update</h2>\nWith the v9.00 update today, we have a number of major gameplay changes and tweaks coming to the game to kick off the new season.<br />\n<br />\nYou may have already noticed within the patch notes, but if not - here\u2019s an update on the items that are vaulted as of this morning:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Balloons\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Clingers</li>\n\t<li>Poison Dart Trap</li>\n\t<li>Pump Shotgun\u00a0</li>\n\t<li>Scoped Revolver</li>\n\t<li>Suppressed Assault Rifle</li>\n\t<li>Thermal Assault Rifle</li>\n\t<li>Treasure Map</li>\n</ul>\nHere are some of the new or legacy items returning today:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Combat Shotgun (for full details check our patch notes)</li>\n\t<li>Grenades</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nAdditionally we\u2019ve included a change that will keep your character in the match for 60 seconds after disconnecting or forcefully leaving a match. This means that you will potentially provide elimination points to enemies after a disconnect, and helps discourage forced exits.\n<p><em>Why vault all those things? And the Pump???</em></p>\nWe want the beginning of each Season to feel fresh and allow for a new gameplay experience along with all the new Seasonal content. Whether its new cross-map mobility, new weapons, or just new places to drop - you should feel like there is plenty to explore and experience. Specifically when it comes to Pump Shotguns, they stand out significantly: they currently account for over 26% of eliminations in default playlists, with the next weapon type not even coming close. Rather than nerfing the Pump Shotgun to a point where it no longer lives up to its fantasy, our preference is to return it to the vault, giving us an opportunity to revisit the general balance of the item, while introducing a new shotgun.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nOur goal with the Combat Shotgun is to provide an item that fills a similar niche, but with a different risk and reward. We\u2019re excited to see how you all use the new shotgun and look forward to your feedback on this shift.<br />\n\u00a0",

         "content": "Hey all,<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re kicking off a competitive hot topics post this week covering work being done to maintain the integrity of official Fortnite competitions and an update on issues from this past weekend.\u00a0\u00a0\n<h2><br />\nOfficial Competitive Ruling</h2>\nBased on an internal investigation, we have concluded that a group of players attempted to undermine the Week 3 Fortnite World Cup Online Open competition on April 28 by colluding across several matches.<br />\n<br />\nAll players involved will receive a 14 day competitive ban and will be ineligible for any Week 3 prizes. This group also included a player whose score would have qualified them for the Fortnite World Cup finals in New York. Consequently, in addition to the competitive ban and loss of prizing, this player will also forfeit their Fortnite World Cup Finals qualification spot. As a result, the qualification spot will be granted to the next highest ranking player on the Week 3 Finals leaderboard for the NA-E region who has yet to qualify for Solos.<br />\n<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events/world-cup/about?sessionInvalidated=true\">Official Rules</a> for the Event stipulate the following:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Rules 8.2.2 & 8.2.3</strong><br />\n<br />\n<em>\"Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (\u201cCollusion\u201d). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nEach player is expected to play to the best of his or her ability at all times during any match and in a way that is consistent with the rules in Sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2.\u201d\u00a0</em><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Section 10</strong><br />\n<br />\n<em>\u201cEpic may disqualify any Participant from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such Participant is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic\u2019s representatives.\u201d</em><br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, we took action against 698 other players for breaking the Official Rules. As a reminder, competing on alternate or new accounts to circumvent competitive bans in any way may result in users being banned from all future competitive play permanently.<br />\n<br />\nWe take Fortnite competitive integrity extremely seriously, and we expect all of our players to live up to the standards specified in the Official Rules. For more information, please see our most recent blog on the subject:\u00a0<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/competitive-game-integrity\">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/competitive-game-integrity</a>.\n\n<h2><br />\nWeekend Issues Update</h2>\nWe\u2019ve recently been able to identify, prioritize, and solve several issues thanks to your help. Clear video evidence, detailed descriptions of problems, and game logs go a long way in helping to accelerate fixes. Thank you!\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Reboot Van spawning issues.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>We discovered an error in which players could respawn if the rebooter did not completely finish the reboot channelled interaction. This bug also caused the game to eliminate the rebooted players after a few seconds. We temporarily disabled the Reboot Van in competitive modes to avoid any potential scoring issues while we worked on a solve.\u00a0</li>\n\t\t<li>Thanks to your help, we\u2019ve fixed and rebooted the Reboot Van in all competitive modes. The Reboot Van now functions as intended; if the rebooter is eliminated while attempting to reboot a teammate, the Reboot stops and is unsuccessful, and both players will be eliminated.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>HLOD textures failing to fully load in Tilted Towers, Retail Row, and Polar Peak.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>This was brought to our attention and hotfixed early Saturday morning.</li>\n\t\t<li>We\u2019re continuing to carefully monitor this, so please continue to call it out if you experience texture issues within Fortnite.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Players unable to build after gliding.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>We discovered an issue where players are unable to build after landing from a glider.</li>\n\t\t<li>We\u2019ve managed to reproduce this bug internally and have slotted a fix in an upcoming release (targeting v9.00).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Turbo Building issues.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Thanks to your help, we discovered a bug with Turbo Build that appears to be tied to certain networking conditions that would cause players to be unable to build for a few frames.</li>\n\t\t<li>We implemented a hotfix on 5/1 which we believe will help address this issue under most network conditions, but we\u2019re still not 100% certain we\u2019ve fixed all cases. We will be closely tracking the fix to make sure the issue is resolved, so please let us know if you run into any additional problems.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\nYou can follow our progress with other bugs and issues with our <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues\">Trello board here</a>.\n\n<h2><br />\nStreaming Replays - Currently only available on PC & Mac</h2>\nThis past weekend, we launched streaming replays so you can quickly watch the matches you\u2019ve just played or share them across social with friends. In an effort to balance the desire to have replays available ASAP while not creating competitive fairness issues, we\u2019ll be reducing the delay on replay availability from 10 minutes down to 5 minutes before you can view the replay from a specific match. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate delay window, and look forward to your feedback.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nNote: Replays are only valid until the next major update (e.g. v9.00) and are currently only available on PC and Mac.\n<h2>Week 4 Fortnite World Cup Online Open Schedule Adjustments</h2>\nThis upcoming weekend, there will be some slight schedule adjustments for the Semi-Finals of the Fortnite World Cup Online Opens.<br />\n<br />\n<u>Europe Semi-Finals</u><br />\n<br />\n2:00 PM UTC - 5:00 PM UTC\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<u>Brazil Semi-Finals</u><br />\n<br />\n5:00 PM Brasilia - 8:00 PM Brasilia<br />\n<br />\nAll other regional times will remain unchanged from previous weekends, including the Finals on Sunday. When in doubt, please consult the times listed in game. Best of luck!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\u00a0",

Despite playing from behind after the first 6 matches, <strong>CoverH</strong> and <strong>Twizz</strong> were able to roll off huge games at the end, earning them the top spot.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNx5OTQMQK0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Asia</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>CR.bell</strong> and <strong>Scarlet No.1</strong> from Japan were able to secure the only qualifying spot out of this region. Their balanced approach of high eliminations,combined with chasing high placements concluded with them edging out the competition. Their final match earned them 14 points, putting them in first place with a three point lead.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNI_mGOskE4\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Europe</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europe proved to be a battleground for its four qualifying spots. Requiring 58 points in the semi-final to even compete on Sunday, those top four places would be difficult to obtain. In the end, <strong>NRG benjyfishy </strong>and <strong>NRG MrSavageM </strong>took the top spot, with familiar names like <strong>Secret_Mongraal, Atlantis Mitr0, E11 Stompy</strong> and <strong>E11 Tschiiiinken</strong> just behind them in second and third place.<strong> Lootboy Skram</strong> and <strong>Lootboy Mexe </strong>took the final spot, pushing out Solary Airwaks and Solary Nikof in their very last match with a 20 point performance. <strong>Stompy</strong> and <strong>benjyfishy</strong> also became the first two players in Fortnite history to qualify for both the solo and the Duos competition at the Fortnite World Cup Final.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5pXEwZ6CqA\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Brazil</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Brazil <strong>Code W7M-Nicks </strong>continued to prove he is one of the players to watch coming out of South America. After a second place finish last week, he and his Duo<strong> W7M pfzin </strong>were able to secure the only Duo qualification spot. Their 36 combined points in their 5th and 6th game gave them an insurmountable lead and let them ride out the rest of the finals in first place.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_y3hkAYBb_o\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">NA-East</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Familiar names were seen up at the top for a long stretch, but in the end, the three spots were earned by some relatively new faces at the top of the leaderboard. <strong>OT Spadess </strong>and <strong>Woofgang crimz</strong> were able to take the number one spot with 90 points, ending with an impressive 14 point final match. The Duo of <strong>MSF Clix</strong> and <strong>MSF Sceptic</strong> were also able to put up a couple of huge matches at the end, securing them the second spot at 87 points. <strong>Envy LeNain</strong> (who just missed qualifying for solos last week) and <strong>LG Tyler15</strong> were also able earn 87 points, putting them one point ahead of 4th place and booking their trip to the final.</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uiEIbtwjSs\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">NA-West</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The last region of the day had 6 different teams vying for the single qualifying spot.

         "title": "Fortnite Competitive Development Update",
         "content": "There are several key principles that drive Fortnite development. First, we aim to provide a fun game that\u2019s inclusive of all players, and provides everyone with a real chance of winning through any combination of skill, strategy, and good fortune. Second, we aim to evolve the game rapidly to keep the experience fresh. Finally, we aim to provide great entertainment.<br />\n<br />\nFortnite competitive play relies on a unique balancing act: maintaining a solid and balanced experience for competitive players, while being essentially the same Fortnite played by hundreds of millions of players. After all, those players are the audience for Fortnite competition, and their engagement is key to the growing opportunities for competitive players.<br />\n<br />\nThis creates special challenges for addressing the needs of different groups of players. We closely follow the dialog in the Fortnite competitive community, but haven\u2019t been as active participants in the discussion as we ought to be. So, we\u2019ll be trying harder to participate by sharing the \u201cwhy\u201d behind recent and future changes as a basis for ongoing community discussion, starting with this.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Siphon / Material Change</strong><br />\nLet\u2019s start with the Siphon and building material changes.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nUnder the pressure of intense broadcast competition, play styles differ significantly from regular play, with less aggression in the early game resulting in a crowded end-game overabundant in turtling. We introduced Siphon during the Pop-up Cup tournaments to provide incentives for aggression that more closely resembles how the regular modes are played, and to increase entertainment value and spectacle.<br />\n<br />\nEverybody enjoyed receiving health and shields for eliminations after we introduced the changes to the core modes, but there was an unexpected consequence: players at large grew more frustrated with Fortnite play, feeling they had less of a chance due to encounters with high-skill players with full health and shields. Ultimately, Siphon increased engagement for the highest-skilled 10%, while the remaining 90% were more frustrated and played less.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nOver time, players began to disengage in the core modes, stating that the game had gotten too intense to be enjoyable. The reduction in viable play styles in combination with this feedback was the basis of us removing the Siphon mechanic and the material changes from the core modes.<br />\n<br />\nFor players that prefer the sharper experience of Siphon, we do offer an always-available Arena mode that includes these Siphon and materials cap changes.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stretched Resolution and Field of View (FOV)</strong><br />\nMany competitive players have asked for an FOV slider to improve visibility in vertical end-game build battles. There has also been ire over our removal of stretched resolution (a relic of supporting old 4:3 TVs which results in a distorted screen aspect ratio).<br />\n<br />\nWhen a game introduces a feature that provides a gameplay advantage, players gravitate towards turning it on to maximize their chances of success, even if this makes the game look and/or feel worse. The stretched characters and distorted views detract from Fortnite as an entertainment experience for all.<br />\n<br />\nFundamentally, we seek to avoid optional settings which provide players with a significant gameplay advantage.<br />\n<br />\nThe current default FOV of 80 is a tradeoff to accommodate:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Varied engagement ranges, favoring a low FOV and thus a closer view of enemies.</li>\n\t<li>Minimizing potential motion-sickness in players further away from their screen. The further a player\u2019s head moves from the center of the in-game field of view, the more negative the reaction.</li>\n\t<li>Minimizing jarring transitions when aiming down sights.</li>\n\t<li>Visual fidelity.</li>\n\t<li>Performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Game Evolution</strong><br />\nWe have many goals we want to accomplish for players, and sometimes there is tension between these goals. Special events bring change and freshness to the game, but also affect some of the stable elements that competitive players have trained for.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWeekends are the ideal time for the largest number of players to be able to experience special one-time moments, compete in tournaments, and watch them.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nFortnite is an ever evolving game. Keeping the gameplay and the tournaments fresh is a key aspect to growing a player and viewership base that enables a large number of high-stakes tournaments for competitors and everyone who enjoys watching them.<br />\n<br />\nWe aim to reasonably stabilize gameplay in advance of the Fortnite World Cup Finals. We had hoped to stabilize for all Online Qualifiers, however the new weekly online tournament cadence means we will be doing this for some, but not all.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Bugs</strong><br />\nThere are a series of bugs most commonly experienced during higher end play we have been inconsistent about acknowledging and addressing.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nHere\u2019s a few we\u2019ve recently added to our Trello that were recently resolved or we are actively tracking:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Fortnite World Cup Online Opens points tracked incorrectly in client (visual only).</li>\n\t<li>Ghost shots: player clearly shoots another player, but no damage is done.</li>\n\t<li>Trap can sometimes be placed halfway through a tile \u00a0- Fixed in v8.50.</li>\n\t<li>The Baller is destroyed if the driver exits the vehicle in a confined space (e.g. 1x1) - Fixed in v8.40.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nA lot of them require your help as they are hard for us to reproduce internally and we are utilizing recurring small scale feedback sessions with the competitive community to narrow down on fixes.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re committed to doing a better job monitoring bug reports through Reddit, social channels, and in-game reports. Please help us by posting detailed bug reports including video clips.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Future Topics</strong><br />\nRe-evaluating how we communicate with our competitive players includes touching on topics you care about in places you\u2019re having discussions. Going forward, we will be more present in online forums to chat about the evolution of Arena and competition formats as we progress along the competitive season.<br />\n\u00a0",

In 8.40, we turned off this detection in custom matches to allow content creators greater freedom to experiment on the island, \u00a0but it remains enabled in all competitive play.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re working on improving the teaming detection so we can enable it in all game modes while also allowing for fun, playful interactions with other players. \u00a0We\u2019ll make an announcement when the new detection goes live in those modes.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, if we discover teaming during a tournament we will action those users accordingly. \u00a0Don\u2019t be those players!</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Replays</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Internally we occasionally use server replays to verify tournament integrity, and you can check them out too. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bdal2f/fortnite_world_cup_online_open_week_1_replays/\">Click here</a> to check out how you can view the World Cup - Online Open Week 1 replays in the Fortnite client.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">See something? Say something\u2026 nicely.</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We appreciate the community&#39;s concern around the integrity of the competition, but questioning the results of an individual participant without direct evidence unfairly tears apart what should be a crowning moment of achievement for an individual or team who earned their way there and performed when it counted.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you do have a competitive integrity issue that you\u2019d like to report or have a question about competitive play, please contact us through our <a href=\"https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/epic-games-competitive/?contact=1\">player support team</a>. \u00a0They\u2019ll help to make sure that your inquiry will end up in the right place.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also report players in-game for cheating, exploiting, harassment, and more. \u00a0Your reports are instrumental in helping us identify potential bad dudes quickly - we appreciate you taking the time to submit those reports.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our primary goal is to support competition that is fun, inclusive, and in line with the overall spirit of Fortnite. Unsportsmanlike conduct from participants is not within that spirit, and will not be tolerated in Fortnite competition.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks, and good luck out there competing!</p>\n",

         "content": "<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Fortnite World Cup Online Open Week 1 Recap</h1>\n\n<h2><br />\nOceania</h2>\nGoons Volx was strong out of the gate, and built a commanding lead. However, <strong>slaya</strong> excelled through his last few matches, and a 16 elimination/10th place final match put him 1 point above Goons Volx in the closing moments.<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Asia</h2>\n<strong>Top_FaxFox</strong> dominated from the start. He won his first 4 matches, averaging 8 eliminations per match. Starting strong with 72 points in the first half of his games, he would go on to earn 84 total points and earn a spot in New York City.\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2>Europe</h2>\nEurope saw solo veterans rise to the top, but some lesser known faces were able to qualify into the Finals. Competition was fierce as <strong>E11 Stompy</strong> took the top spot with 74 points with <strong>TQ Prisi0n3r0</strong>, \u00a0on his heels with 72 points.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<strong>NRG benjyfishy</strong> came in third place and <strong>hREDS BELAEU</strong>, grabbed the 4th spot with a clutch last game. <strong>Gambit.letw1k3</strong> was just behind <strong>BELAEU</strong> with 66 points, utilizing every game effectively to get well inside the top 8.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nBoth <strong>LDLC Nayte</strong> and <strong>S2V DiegoGB</strong> secured 61 points, claiming the 6th and 7th spots just 3 points clear of the last qualifying spot. The 8th spot came down to a 3-way tie between <strong>TrainH DRG</strong>, VGIA Khisanth and Solary Airwaks. <strong>DRG</strong> claimed the top tiebreaker with a well executed victory royale in a Rift-To-Go situation. This additional victory gave him the final spot from Europe.<br />\n<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>NA-East</h2>\nThere were six spots were up for grabs for NA-East in a tight competition from start to finish. <strong>SEN Bugha</strong> took the top spot with 69 points, only 9 points clear of 6th place and only one point ahead of <strong>Dubs fn</strong>, who came 2nd. Competitive veteran <strong>Ghost Bizzle</strong> took 3rd with some very consistent games, showing solo experience and practice pays off.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TSM_Comadon</strong> secured 4th, with two clutch Victory Royales pushing him 3 points clear of the 5 way tie at 60 points for the last two spots. Victory Royales would again prove to be the difference, giving <strong>Liquid Vivid</strong> and <strong>100T Ceice</strong> the 5th and 6th spots.<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>Brazil</h2>\nThe battle in South America came down to the final moments! W7M-Nicks stormed out to a huge lead, grabbing eliminations throughout the competition with very impressive numbers, but <strong>QUASAR leleo</strong> would not be stopped. Playing one less game than Nicks, and going for a more balanced approach of maximizing placement and elimination points, <strong>leleo</strong> was able to edge Nicks out in his last game by 1 point.<br />\n\u00a0\n<h2>NA-West</h2>\nThe final region of the first Online Open decided the two spots remaining. Ultimately, <strong>snow xd</strong> and <strong>Bloom Riversan</strong> were able to outstrip the rest of the competition by a good margin. Both played only 8 of their possible 10 matches, managing to score 83 and 80 points, with two of the best average points per game and the only qualifiers with a double digit lead over opponents.\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0",

         "title": "Competitive Fortnite State of Development",
         "content": "Heya Fortnite Community,\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe Fortnite World Cup Online Open starts on April 13. Let\u2019s gear up by diving into a few feature updates right around the corner and upcoming competitive events on the horizon.\u00a0\n<h2>Arena Mode</h2>\nThe v8.20 update kicked off Arena Mode and players have rapidly been earning Hype while working their way through the divisions towards the Champion League. \u00a0We will continue to iterate on Arena by providing new scoring formats, league-specific tournaments, and custom rewards upon reaching new divisions.<br />\n<br />\nOne area we\u2019ve heard your pain is with longer queue times in higher levels of competitive play, so we are investigating a solution: the ability to play while you wait! We&#39;ll place you into a match or Creative Island during those longer queue times to keep you warmed up. While that solution is a little way out, we\u2019ll be regularly updating matchmaking logic for Arena to provide a better experience for players in all divisions.\n<h2>Performance Improvements</h2>\nImproving late game performance is a priority for us. We\u2019ll start by bringing the opt-in FPS display to console and mobile which will help us better monitor live gameplay performance when digging into your reports. The display itself will get a minor improvement to include a rolling min and max value to help catch long frames at fast rates.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re also actively investigating uneven framerates, hitching and late-game performance from multiple community reports and competitive match breakdowns. Our goal across upcoming releases is to iterate on common stalls that directly impact gameplay and provide a more consistent endgame experience. The v8.30 update contains improvements to multithreaded rendering performance in heavier scenes for console and desktop as well as a fix for a hitch related to vehicles.\n<h2>Stretched Resolution</h2>\nIn the near future, we will be updating how we handle custom resolutions on PC. When using a custom resolution, vertical FOV will be locked. Horizontal FOV will be unlocked in all modes, but in competitive playlists (e.g. Arena and in-game tournaments) we will be locking the aspect ratio to 16:9.\n\n<h2>Server Replays</h2>\nLast weekend, we were able to make server replays from the Luxe Cup <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b7j5wk/luxe_cup_replays_available_for_testing/\">available to players for the first time</a>. With these files came the ability to utilize our work-in-progress broadcast spectating tools.

In the future, we aim to have our broadcast tools available for both on-demand replays and streaming games in client on all platforms. We\u2019ll be watching for all of the great replay edits uploaded by you across social channels and will share our favorites with the rest of the Fortnite community!\n\n<h2>Fortnite World Cup Warmup</h2>\nThe Fortnite World Cup Online Open tournaments begin on April 13, but with one last weekend to go we\u2019ll be holding the Fortnite World Cup Warmup. This is our last online practice tournament and will feature a $500,000 prize pool with a much broader prize distribution than previous weeks. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe Fortnite World Cup Warmup Semi-Finals will be held on Saturday, 4/6. Any eligible Duo who has both players reach Division 6 in Contender\u2019s League in Arena Mode will be able to hop in during the three hour event window. The top 1,500 Duos in each region will advance to the Finals on Sunday, 4/7.<br />\n<br />\nFull rules for the Fortnite World Cup Warmup will be available later this week here: <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news\">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news</a>\n\n<h2>2FA</h2>\nAs a reminder, all players who compete in the Final Round of the Fortnite World Cup Warmup and other cash prize tournaments will be required to enable 2FA and link their account to an Epic ID. You can do so by following our guide <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/2fa\">here.</a>\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nIn the future, we may require 2FA to participate in earlier rounds, so it\u2019s best to double-check in advance. Our support team is also equipped to assist those that need help with their current 2FA access by submitting a ticket <a href=\"https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1\">here.</a><br />\n<br />\nWe hope to see you on the Fortnite world stage!<br />\n<br />\n- The Fortnite Competitive Team",

         "title": "Competitive Fortnite State of Development - Part 2",
         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Howdy Folks,<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re back with Part 2 of our Competitive Fortnite series, and ready to share more information about what\u2019s coming, and our vision for 2019 and beyond.</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Official Fortnite Competition\u00a0</h1>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The vision for competition in Fortnite is to make competitive play broadly available to everyone. This includes more game modes, playstyles and formats in structured competition. This broadens the scope and definition of competitive Fortnite while also celebrating exceptional talent and a variety of gameplay skills across all of Fortnite\u2019s game modes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Tools and Upcoming Features</h1>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Competitive Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our in-game tournament system allows us to bring prized competition to a large group of players, and we\u2019re eager to include more regions of the world. Winter Royale was operated through the in-game tournament system and featured more than 9,200,000 players across North America and Europe competing during the two-day qualifiers. We just recently introduced parts of our new tournament backend system that will enable new features in the near future such as in-game leaderboards, tournaments that take place across multiple knockout rounds, and more varied events to keep the play experience fresh and fun.<br />\n<br />\nAs part of our system upgrades, earning a pin or achieving a high placement during a qualification round can now advance you further in that tournament - or even unlock a new, private tournament which is only available to players who successfully managed to earn a pin. \u00a0We&#39;ll be experimenting with a variety of approaches and tournament structures utilizing these tools over the coming months to see which types of events provide the most fun and exciting experiences for players of all skill levels.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThroughout 2019, we plan to support a number of high quality, third-party tournament organizers. So far this year, we\u2019ve partnered with the Australian Open, ESL in Katowice, ggCircuit and a few local event organizers. As we improve and polish our public tools, we look forward to working with more partners on all kinds of events. We hope that by empowering event organizers to host meaningful competitions throughout the year, we can provide more opportunities for Fortnite players to compete around the world.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Spectator & Broadcast</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our core feature set for 2019\u2019s major events are in place. We now have the ability to broadcast from physical and online events, and our spectator client has in-match scoreboard screens and a variety of map views on which we will continue to iterate.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nA priority during the early part of this year will be integrating the spectator client with the new online tournament system. We believe it\u2019s important to have tools that help highlight the stories of standout players on their journey to the Fortnite World Cup.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ll continue to improve our broadcast HUD, and new capabilities with our stats and analytics tools will help us tell a player\u2019s story across multiple matches and tournaments. On the broadcast HUD, we\u2019re taking a look at what information is most important and how to best present that information for the many ways in which viewers watch competitive Fortnite.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Broadcast1.png\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite+Esports%2Fnews%2Fcompetitive-fortnite-state-of-development-part-2%2FBroadcast1-1920x1080-e5e1f8563a5520028afe19000ddbfa1b11d5bd35.png\" width=\"auto\" /><br />\n<img alt=\"Broadcast2.png\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite+Esports%2Fnews%2Fcompetitive-fortnite-state-of-development-part-2%2FBroadcast2-1920x1080-894d35399a332fa938780930e81511a5d4a0f5a4.png\" width=\"auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Anti-Cheat</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our zero-tolerance cheating policy remains in effect, and any player that is determined to be cheating will be removed and permanently banned from Fortnite.<br />\n<br />\nBefore the Fortnite World Cup begins, we\u2019re working to implement new features that will add additional layers of security to our tournament system. We have introduced new requirements behind the scenes for entry into our competitions, and are investigating additional requirements that will raise the bar in keeping prior cheaters out of the competition. \u00a0We also have recently made significant improvements to our in-game reporting feature, which will allow our monitoring team to quickly investigate and action cheaters. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Stats</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As previously mentioned, leaderboard capability is fast approaching and will be accessible for in-game tournaments. There will also be match summaries that display your placement performance compared to your elimination performance for any given tournament. Using stats to help inform you about your progress in competitive play can be a great tool to better your in-game performance, and we want to continue surfacing vital information.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nFor broadcast, accurate and timely stats directly impact our ability to deliver an enjoyable viewing experience for official competitions. Throughout much of last year we were not satisfied with how quickly we were able to relay vital information like overall standings or a competitor\u2019s game-by-game performance. Right now we\u2019re trying to cut down the time needed to update broadcast graphics by improving the time it takes for real-time stats to deliver information to our broadcast team. We are also expanding on the types of stats we\u2019re tracking to help casters stay more informed and provide a better storytelling narrative throughout competitions. Casters will eventually be able to use real-time scoring so that they always know where a player stands in a competition.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Ranked</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The in-game tournament system is an evolution of the traditional ranked system, striving to enhance the best elements of ranked play. Focused windows of competition allow us to better celebrate the performances of competitors, promote community activity around the events, and create the highest quality matches possible at all skill levels. We\u2019ll be exploring rotating or staggered tournament schedules in the future to include more players.</p>\n\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">You can expect more details on competitive Fortnite and the Fortnite World Cup in the coming weeks!</h3>\n",

Don\u2019t tell anyone, but we\u2019ll be awarding $500,000 in prize money for this 2-day event. This invitational will include top players from each Open Fortnite competition held so far.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nRumor has it that the event will be held in a classified, undisclosed testing facility on <strong>February 14th and 15th</strong>. Each match will be transmitted to our official channels. You can expect the same high-powered matches as TwitchCon and PAX, but also expect us to explore additional\u2026 <em>operations</em>\u2026 during the two days of competition. Keep a close eye on upcoming announcements as we uncover more details for this event.<br />\n<br />\nThis event will covertly be used to better prepare our broadcast team for the upcoming Fortnite World Cup later this year. We\u2019re incredibly excited to share more details soon on how you can participate in the Fortnite World Cup.\n<h3><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"background-color:#000000;\">Remember, it\u2019s a secret.

You can expect three parts regarding recent learnings, overall Fortnite competition, and upcoming feature sets. Let\u2019s dive in!<br />\n<br />\nLast year was an invaluable learning experience for the entire Fortnite Competitive team. In the past six months, there have been 33 official online North American and European competitions and two major offline competitions. Those competitions tallied to approximately $20 million in prizes awarded to nearly 1,000 players. Each one of these competitions is helping to grow, evolve and shape the competitive Fortnite experience.\u00a0\n<h2>Patch Releases and Competition</h2>\nWe value the ability of players to adapt to the game changing over time. We also believe these changes keep Fortnite fresh for everyone including players, competitors and spectators. However, we want to provide reasonable time for you to adjust strategies following large gameplay impacting changes, for example prior to official Fortnite competitions. This time window could range from a few days to a week of a release.<br />\n<br />\nThis begins with the upcoming Australian Open, which will use the core Battle Royale modes during the competition, and something we will continue to take into account throughout 2019. Fortnite will continue to update every week, however for major, official Fortnite competitions we may adjust for competitive needs.\u00a0\n<h3>Stay tuned for more info on Competitive Fortnite!</h3>\n<br />\n\u00a0",

         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Hello Fortnite competitors,<br />\n<br />\nThe high intensity battles you know from the Fall Skirmish have come to an end, but we\u2019re excited to announce the next phase of Fortnite competitive play: the Winter Royale Online Tournament! Today we\u2019re also revealing some major updates to our tournament system and other plans for the near future of competitive.</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Online Tournament Fixes</h1>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last month, we released our in-game tournament system. With your help, we identified some critical issues that resulted in the system not accomplishing our goals for a competitive environment.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/patch-notes/v6-30?sessionInvalidated=true\">v6.30</a> update, we made critical fixes to in-game tournament matchmaking and various other bugs to provide a more competitive experience. For example, we found that players\u2019 point totals were not influencing their matchmaking at all. Now, players will be correctly matched against opponents with similar point totals. The deeper you advance in a tournament, the more challenging the matches will become. Please note that players with many points may have to wait more than 5 minutes to find a suitable match. We will continue to explore the best fit for competition by adjusting the matchmaking process over time as needed.<br />\n<br />\nWe also fixed a few issues around incorrect point totals showing up post match, or points being slow to update. We hope to get closer to real-time point tracking as we move forward.<br />\n<br />\nWe will continue to improve this system over time, so if you haven\u2019t given the Online Tournaments a chance since these updates, jump in during the competition windows and truly test your skills!</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Pop Up Cups</h1>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019ll start to notice different \u201cPop-Up Cups\u201d within the events tab. These will be online tournaments with different game settings. Think of these as the equivalent of Competitive LTMs where we can test large adjustments in a more competitive environment.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nBe sure you pay attention to the settings for each Pop-Up Cup via the \u201cTournament Details\u201d button in the in-game events tab. The rules and gameplay will change over time similar to Limited Time Modes. We plan to iterate and explore different in-game adjustments by closely monitoring competitive play in these Pop-Ups. Please continue to provide feedback and let us know what you think!</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">$1,000,000 Winter Royale Open Fortnite Competition</h1>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Online Tournament system will be used next year to determine participants in the Fortnite World Cup. Starting later this month, we will hold a test event that will emulate the World Cup Qualification process. This will help us gather valuable learnings to better prepare for the process next year.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThe Solo test events will consist of two parts, the Winter Royale Qualifiers and the Winter Royale Finals, which will have a total of $1,000,000 in prizes up for grabs.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThere will be several chances for anyone to try and get a high score during the Winter Royale Qualifier days. The highest score you achieve during any event session will be the one that counts, so be sure to give it your all!\u00a0As part of our ongoing competitive tests to prepare for the Fortnite World Cup, Winter Royale will use the same game settings as the currently available Pop-Up Cup.<br />\n<br />\nThe top performers in each region for NA and EU will be verified, and those players found eligible will be invited to participate in the Winter Royale Finals for their region. While this tournament will be restricted to NA and EU, we&#39;re planning on holding other region-specific tournaments in additional regions in the near future.<br />\n<br />\nFor those interested in competing, our Winter Royale competition dates will be the following:</p>\n\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li>\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Winter Royale Qualifier (Open): 11/24/2018 - 11/25/2018</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Europe Winter Royale Finals: 11/30/2018 - 12/1/2018</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">North America Winter Royale Finals: 12/11/2018 - 12/12/2018</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">For specific times and a listing of all other online tournaments, be sure to follow the schedule in the in-game events tab. Best of luck!</h2>\n",

         "content": "Fortnite fans,<br />\n<br />\nWith the release of v6.10, we\u2019re excited to introduce In-Game Tournaments which will be located in the new \u2018Events\u2019 section of Fortnite Battle Royale. \u00a0<br />\n<br />\nIn-Game Tournaments are <em><strong>open to everyone</strong></em> and provide an opportunity for every player to compete directly alongside the pros for prizes and glory. Note that all players must opt-in for crossplay to participate in competitive events.\n<h1>What are In-Game Tournaments?</h1>\nEach tournament has a series of scheduled dates and times during which the competition will be run. Each of these scheduled sessions is a completely clean slate - all players will begin with the same score and compete over several hours of intense competition to earn as many points as possible. Players can earn points by either achieving high placements or eliminating multiple opponents.<br />\n<br />\nMatchmaking during a tournament session will pair players with similar point standings, so if you\u2019re playing well within the session you\u2019ll find yourself matched with stronger opponents. If you\u2019re struggling then you should find an easier time the longer the session goes on.<br />\n<br />\nTournaments will feature a target score to strive towards - reaching this score will award you with a shiny pin celebrating your accomplishment. In the future, earning a pin may advance you to the next round of a tournament or qualify you to win prizes.\n<h1>Mouse vs Controller vs Touch</h1>\nDuring tournaments, players from all platforms will compete against one another<strong> <em>as equals</em></strong>, regardless of if they are on a Mouse, Controller, or Touch input device. \u00a0Every player will participate in the same competitions from start to finish, with equal opportunity to rise above the competition.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve been observing the performance of controller players in our Summer Skirmish, PAX West, and Fall Skirmish tournaments while playing against mouse and keyboard players at the highest levels of competition. Competitors such as NickMercs, Ayden, KamoLRF, and AmarCoD have shown that controller players can be successful while competing against some of the best PC players in the world.<br />\n<br />\nCombining everyone into a single competition will allow for players to compete with their friends regardless of platforms and will allow us to place a single shining spotlight onto the world\u2019s best players, increasing prize pools and player exposure from our competitions.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ll be continuing to assess this throughout the 2019 competitive season and are evaluating offering some tournaments restricted to specific input devices or platforms.<br />\n<br />\nInitial Schedule<br />\n<br />\nOn release, the following tournaments will be scheduled in NA*, EU, BR, ASIA, and OCE regions. \u00a0Scheduled times will vary by region - check the tournament inside the client for details.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Alpha Tournament (Solo)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Dates: October 16 - October 21</li>\n\t\t<li>Description: Participate in the first in-game tournament, spanning across several days of daily competition!\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Beta Tournament (Duo)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Dates: October 23 - October 25</li>\n\t\t<li>Description: Grab a friend and take on the world - until you are the last two left.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Friday Night Fortnite (Squad)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Dates: October 19 - November 30</li>\n\t\t<li>Description: Join your friends every Friday and kick off your weekend with some exciting Squad action.\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Salty Springs Cup (Solo)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Dates: October 27 - October 31</li>\n\t\t<li>Description: One week and three attempts to prove you&#39;re the saltiest that Salty Springs has to offer.\u00a0</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Tomato Temple Cup (Duo)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Dates: October 28 - November 1</li>\n\t\t<li>Description: Become legends of the Tomato Temple Cup.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<em>*Note: NAE and NAW are combined together into the same tournament, but players will still connect to their nearest server except in low population circumstances primarily when a player has a high score.</em>\n\n<h1>Into the Future</h1>\nOver the next few months, we\u2019ll be continuing to develop the tournaments feature to allow for events to occur across multiple rounds, requiring players to have earned a pin to qualify for each subsequent round.<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019re working toward establishing an exciting and varied schedule of tournaments for players of all talent levels, featuring new scoring formats and support for additional modes.<br />\n<br />\nBeginning later this year, all eligible players will have the opportunity to qualify for the 2019 Fortnite World Cup directly through a \u2018Showdown Royale\u2019 event hosted using the in-game tournament system.<br />\n\u00a0",

To make that possible we\u2019ve had to harden and scale our systems and infrastructure. For example, August was Fortnite\u2019s biggest month yet, with 78.3 million of you showing up to play. This exposed weak points and allowed us to make targeted improvements to critical systems, such as stats and servers. The Summer Skirmish also, as you all probably noticed, highlighted problems with performance and spectating, which we\u2019ve been working on ever since. We\u2019re excited about kicking off the new competition system and we\u2019ll have details dropping in the weeks ahead.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On to the Fall Skirmish! In our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fall-skirmish-announcement\">previous blog</a> we mentioned the Fall Skirmish will include a variety of play formats each week. All Skirmish long we\u2019ll be iterating on broadcast tools, new weekly formats and using that information to help inform our decisions for future competitive events and the Fortnite World Cup.</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Clubs</h1>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019ve invited over 500 Fortnite community creators and competitors and divided them into 5 distinct Clubs. Each player will represent one of these Clubs for the entire 6 weeks of Fall Skirmish.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fort Knights</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lucky Llamas</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Dusty Dogs</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Rift Raiders</h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bush Bandits</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<img alt=\"AllClubs.png\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Ffall-skirmish-details%2FAllClubs-978x182-5d518961059375422781727fce0ad1c41204de6b.png\" width=\"auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nClubs will be awarded points for each weekly trial and high skill event based on their members\u2019 performances. In addition to awarding players with prizes for each event, Clubs will be awarded with $4,000,000 in prizes at the conclusion of the Fall Skirmish series based on total points earned.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will have a complete breakdown of each player and their Club on our official Fall Skirmish website.</p>\n\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Formats</h1>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We took a number of learnings from the Summer Skirmish series and are bringing back some formats you may remember from the summer competition. We\u2019ll kick off Week 1 this Friday at 12:00 PM EST with Group 1 play, and follow up at 4:00 PM EST with Group 2 play.</p>\nOutside of the familiar Friday competitions, we are also introducing weekly trials for select members of each Club to complete in order to earn additional points for their Club. As always, expect Fall Skirmish to continue to mix up the formats each week with subtle changes to the Friday competitions and more extravagant changes to the weekly Trials.\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\nWeek 1 Skirmish - Hold the Throne Duos</h2>\nThe Duo team with the most points at the end of 6 matches wins. Victory Royales and Eliminations will be scored to determine placement at the end of the event. The top 10 teams at the end of the competition will be awarded.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Victory Royale: <strong>+3 Points</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2nd-3rd Place: <strong>+2 Points</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4th-5th Place: <strong>+1 Point</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">8+ Eliminations: <strong>+3 Points</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">6-7 Eliminations: <strong>+2 Points</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4-5 Eliminations: <strong>+1 Point</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hold the Throne (Most Eliminations in any Match): <strong>+2 Points</strong></h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>Rewards:\u00a0</div>\n\n<table>\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\u00a0</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Prize</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">Club Points</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">1st</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$67,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">305</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">2nd</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$47,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">215</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">3rd</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$36,250</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">165</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">4th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$25,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">115</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">5th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$20,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">90</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">6th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$15,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">70</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">7th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$12,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">55</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">8th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$10,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">45</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">9th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$8,750</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">40</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">10th</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">$7,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\">35</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0</div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, the Duo who Holds the Throne at the end of the 6 matches will be awarded a bonus of $50,000.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\nWeek 1 Trial - \u201cSquad Goals\u201d</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Players on the same Club will assemble into Squads to play matches on the default Squad playlist.

We\u2019re looking to incorporate some of these new formats into our large-scale events in 2019. During Fall Skirmish, players will proudly represent themed teams and earn points based on their performances in both play formats. Each week will pose new challenges like white-knuckle ATK races, masterful golf outings, mini-games, and of course high skill competition every weekend.<br />\n<br />\nNearly 500 Fortnite community members earned cash prizes during the Summer Skirmish and we can\u2019t wait to grow that number during Fall Skirmish. Keep an eye out for a follow-up blog next week for our week 1 format and team announcements. When we\u2019re closer to TwitchCon we\u2019ll drop all the details on the finale\u2019s competitive format, as well as a way to pre-register on a first-come first-served basis, so stay tuned for more info!<br />\n<br />\nYou\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities beyond Fall Skirmish to win prizes. Showdown Royale kicks off near the beginning of October which gives an in-game tournament system where our entire community will have an opportunity to compete and earn prizes in future competitive events.<br />\n<br />\nGLHF!<br />\n\u00a0",

         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Hello Fortnite competitors,<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve just finished up Summer Skirmish Week 5 and we wanted to give you folks a mid-skirmish update from some of the previous weeks. We\u2019re talkin\u2019 interesting stats, additional info on a few standout performers, and our learnings about formats so far. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of some fun stats from the past weeks:</p>\n\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li>The longest range elimination was scored by HighDistortion, with a 267m knockout of MoNsTcR with a Scoped Assault Rifle.</li>\n\t<li>The longest range sniper elimination was scored by InTheLittleWood on Danzhizzle, with a 247m hunting rifle shot.</li>\n\t<li>In Week 3, three pairings were able to dominate the field, topping the group with 24 eliminations\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>SKT Ghoul and Ghost DMO</li>\n\t\t<li>Mickalow and Robi62</li>\n\t\t<li>Greyfox and mouZ Mops.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Week 4 saw a sizable gap between the elimination leaders from each region. Day One was very tightly packed at the top.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>On Friday NotVivid was able to edge out the pack with 16 eliminations.</li>\n\t\t<li>On Saturday, VP Jamside went off, wracking up an impressive 26 eliminations across the 9 games, averaging just short of 3 eliminations per match.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A general note about statistics\u2026 it\u2019s really difficult to pull off consistent great placements or high elimination games with a lobby full of some of Fortnite\u2019s best players. We wanted to properly salute the talented players that have participated each week.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Rising Showdown Stand Outs</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Showdown players have really been able to make a name for themselves through the Summer Skirmish. One in particular who has quickly risen to the top is NotVivid. He placed 19th and 155th in the two Solo Showdowns, but impressed with consistent performance and high placings during Summer Skirmish. He has bookended the Friday Skirmishes so far, with victories in both Week 1 and Week 4. \u00a0In Week 1, NotVivid and his duo partner were able to fight through the masses to remain on top, and in Week 4 pulled off two clutch victories from behind to steal away the top spot.<br />\n<br />\nAtlantis Mitr0 continued to show stellar consistency by topping Saturday Summer Skirmish group in Week 3. The overall winner of the Blitz Showdown LTM and earned the highest score across all regions - nearly 50 points ahead of the next closest finisher. Since battling his way into the Skirmish, Mitr0 has now finished 13th and 1st in his two entrances, with strong individual performances both times.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Showdown player who has risen to the occasion is Reverse2k. Reverse2k was able to secure an impressive placement in the Blitz Showdown LTM and he has turned that into three very consistent performances in the Summer Skirmish. He had managed to net himself 13th in the Week 2 High Score format, while he and TSM Daequan were able to secure a 16th place finish the following week. Week 4 Reverse catapulted to the forefront, with an amazing 9 elimination game, thrusting him atop NA throne, earning himself 5th place and a large payout.<br />\n<br />\nLastly, there was another Showdown participant who caught fire and surged through the competition to win Week 4\u2019s \u201cHold the Throne\u201d on Saturday. Secret Domentos was able to capture the 58th spot during the July Showdown, but his true potential showed in Week 4 of Summer Skirmish. Domentos was able to win 3 of the 9 matches and racking up an impressive 19 eliminations (3rd highest, behind BlaxTV and Teekzy) storming up the ladder to capture the victory. He\u2019s the only Summer Skirmish competitor to secure three Victory Royales in a single day of competition.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Server Performance and Post-Mortem</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continuing to improve server performance remains a top priority. We\u2019ve integrated a number of improvements over the course of the Summer Skirmish series, however we still aren\u2019t quite where we\u2019d like to be. We&#39;re continuing to look hard at server performance with multiple daily playtests where we capture server performance and identify areas for improvement. We&#39;ll keep taking the things we learn from playtests, Skirmish events, and live server data to push the envelope for high intensity Battle Royale.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One consistent challenge is the act of transitioning from a participating player to an in-game spectator, watching heavy build fights near the final circles from the Player PoV. So far, we haven\u2019t been able to make use of the Live Spectating functionality that we had available at the Pro-Am available on the live servers. This past weekend was the first time we\u2019ve have a limited version of the Live Spectator tool available on the public servers and we\u2019re excited to begin integrating this into our broadcasts.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also recognize that the lack of live statistics make it difficult for casters to tell compelling stories during the matches and the for viewers to watch along with high interest levels. Our analytics team is working to solve these problems. We hope to soon be able to deliver information of all kinds to Fortnite viewers more quickly during events.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019ve had a lot of fun creating new formats each week. There are lots of new learnings that we walk away with after each Summer Skirmish weekend by creating new scoring schemes and incentivizing different win conditions. Some formats have been extremely weighted in one direction over the other in order to observe play behavior and collect statistics over a prolonged series of matches in an isolated, high-stakes environment.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A few of our core values when creating formats are simplicity, match tension and upholding the integrity of Battle Royale. Ultimately, we want to find what gives the competitors the best play experience while maintaining a high level of viewing entertainment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lastly, thanks to the participants and viewers that have been helping us along the way!</p>\n",

         "title": "Summer Skirmish Week 1: Postmortem",
         "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Hey Fortnite folks,</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let\u2019s talk about Week 1 of Summer Skirmish - it did not go as planned, but we definitely learned a lot!</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It represented the first time we\u2019ve been able to bring together a high concentration of some of Fortnite\u2019s most talented players and community creators all in one game. We experienced many pain points from a server performance standpoint and feel we under delivered for the premiere of online competition in Fortnite. While we often run tests to learn how the servers will perform, having significant prizes on the line changed gameplay behavior significantly. In addition, since we chose to highlight the streams of players in the event, most players stayed in the game to spectate after they were eliminated. The combination of these two things led to a gameplay experience that was much worse than we expected.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So let\u2019s unpack what happened, what we\u2019ve learned, and what\u2019s next ...</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Server Performance</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We believe that there are number of factors that caused the poor server conditions during this event. This includes the number of players still alive in the later circles, the number of players that stayed connected to spectate until the end, and the amount of dense building that occured late in the matches. Our top priority now is to understand and optimize server performance in these situations. For example, when an explosion damages a large number of building pieces, and each piece needs to send that event to a large number of connected clients, we get a big spike in server CPU load. We have a lot of ideas about how to handle cases like this better, and are working on that right now. We also think that this work will improve server performance for other intense modes like 50v50.</p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Live Environment Elimination Curves vs. Skirmish Week 1</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Players Left by Circle Radius (Density)</strong><img alt=\"pasted-image-0.png\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fsummer-skirmish-week-1-postmortem%2Fpasted-image-0-1365x807-16ecb45373a69fcd3d56cd966ab525bbc18c99f6.png\" width=\"auto\" /></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#e67e22;\">Orange</span> = Skirmish | <span style=\"color:#2980b9;\">Blue</span> = Normal Duos</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Callouts - <strong>Where normally 10 people alive, 50 in skirmish. \u00a0Where normally winner, 30 alive in skirmish</strong></p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Players Left by Time</strong><img alt=\"pasted-image-0-(1).png\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fsummer-skirmish-week-1-postmortem%2Fpasted-image-0-%281%29-1367x806-27a949579a6460d24b90e89dbb79a08ff123bd84.png\" width=\"auto\" /></p>\n\u00a0\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Features & Formats</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We launched Summer Skirmish ahead of the competitive systems we are actively building and establishing as a way to both highlight the amazing talent in the Fortnite community and to explore the possibilities of competitive Fortnite while those systems are being developed. The learnings from the competition are great indicators for what features and formats we need to improve or rework. At the Fortnite Pro-Am event we unveiled our Spectator feature, which is not currently available on the live environment. The combination of these factors created a broadcast that relied on highlighting community members that are streaming their point of view for the event.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We love the broadcast format because we have the opportunity to spotlight different individuals in the community. The format doesn\u2019t however, allow for the same contextual storytelling that is available through the Live Spectator feature. It\u2019s incredibly apparent in situations where there\u2019s a lot of building going on in the final few circles.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Building Meta</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Week 1 also illustrated some of the difficult player vs. player engagement scenarios with so many talented builders under one roof. Complicated, snaking tunnels make it difficult to follow the action, but also amplify the lack of it (action).</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re thinking carefully about how to address late-game building for long-term health of competitive play. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Placement and Eliminations</strong></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re eager to mix up formats to keep things exciting and entertaining during the Summer Skirmish series. Each week we\u2019ll get to see how incentivizing different elements of the format influences competitor\u2019s decisions. The key takeaways for any formats are the learnings gained in understanding differences in play patterns between public match play and the Private Match environment with a lot of talented players playing against each other.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are curious to see how more elimination heavy incentives influence play, though we want to retain the core values and play experiences that everyone else can relate to in-game. Creating complicated scoring systems can be confusing and anticlimactic if they\u2019re not a part of the core play experience. The one-life survival dynamic creates tough real-time decisions for competitors. Each engagement against similarly skilled opponents presents a risk assessment scenario that is typically not apparent for those competitors (or viewers) when observed in public matches.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Competitors generally need to expend a lot of resources (ammo, health, materials) when attempting to eliminate their opponents. And in team-based play (Duo or Squads) they\u2019re also required to spend additional resources to secure the elimination against a downed opponent. Tactical play becomes more beneficial than flashy play - and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll need to strike the balance.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For week 2 we\u2019ll be exploring a public server format where we\u2019ll be tracking competitor\u2019s performance over a period of 10 games. We intend to pick back up on Private Match play in week 3 of the Summer Skirmish series while we work on server performance issues we experienced this past weekend.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019ll have full details available on the format and list of invited players available on Friday!</p>\n",
